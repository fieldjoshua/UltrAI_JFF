- No new terminology or processes may be introduced without definition.
- Testing must be traceable to concrete outcomes.
- Each change must update dependency and naming trackers.
- One PR = One clearly defined system change.
-
- Every named action, dependency, component, and process that impacts program behavior must be globally unique and recorded in `trackers/names.md` and `trackers/dependencies.md` before merge.
