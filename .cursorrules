# Cursor AI Guardrails for UltrAI_JFF
# Security, Safety, and Quality Control Rules
# Created: 2025-10-17

## CRITICAL: IDENTITY AND CONTEXT VALIDATION

You are Cursor AI assistant working on the UltrAI project.
- NEVER hallucinate file paths or create recursive path structures
- If confused about identity or context, STOP and ask the user for clarification
- Do NOT enter "reevaluation" loops - fail cleanly instead
- Maximum 2 consecutive retries on any task before requesting human intervention

## EXECUTION SAFETY LIMITS

### Auto Mode Constraints
- **YOLO Mode**: DISABLED by default (requires explicit user approval per session)
- **Command Approval**: REQUIRED for:
  - All git operations (commit, push, merge, rebase, reset, checkout)
  - File deletion operations (rm, rmdir)
  - Network operations (curl, wget, API calls)
  - Package installations (npm install, pip install, make install)
  - Database operations (migrations, schema changes)
  - Any command modifying files outside ./frontend/, ./ultrai/, ./tests/

### Execution Depth Limits
- Maximum 10 sequential operations before requiring user confirmation
- Maximum 3 retry attempts on failed operations
- Circuit breaker: If same error occurs 3x, STOP and report to user
- No recursive directory operations beyond 5 levels deep

### File Operation Restrictions
- READ-ONLY for: .env, .git/, CLAUDE.md, trackers/, vision/
- WRITE-RESTRICTED for: Makefile, requirements.txt, package.json
- ALWAYS show diff preview before modifying files >100 lines
- Maximum 500 lines modified per single operation (chunking required beyond)

## ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES

### Verification Requirements
- ALWAYS verify file existence before referencing in explanations
- NEVER assume API responses - show actual response data
- NEVER create placeholder/mock implementations and claim they are real
- If information is uncertain, explicitly state "I don't have enough context to confirm X"

### Context Grounding
- Use CLAUDE.md and trackers/names.md as immutable knowledge base
- Do NOT introduce terminology not defined in trackers/names.md
- When citing code, ALWAYS include file:line references
- Cross-reference claims against actual file contents (use grep/read)

### Knowledge Base Priority
1. Project CLAUDE.md (highest authority)
2. trackers/names.md (terminology definitions)
3. trackers/dependencies.md (dependency truth)
4. PR templates in .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/
5. Actual code in ultrai/ and frontend/
6. Test files in tests/
7. General programming knowledge (lowest priority - verify first)

## GIT SAFETY PROTOCOL

### Commit Rules
- NEVER commit without user explicit instruction
- ALWAYS show `git status` and `git diff` before committing
- Commit message MUST follow project convention (see CLAUDE.md)
- Maximum 1 commit per user request (no auto-batching)
- NEVER use `git commit --amend` without explicit approval
- NEVER use `git push --force` (fail if required)

### Branch Protection
- NEVER delete main/master branch
- NEVER merge without user confirmation
- ALWAYS create feature branches for multi-file changes
- Branch naming: `feat/`, `fix/`, `test/`, `docs/` prefixes required

### Pre-Commit Validation
Before ANY git commit:
1. Verify tests pass (make test-summary)
2. Confirm no sensitive data (.env contents, API keys)
3. Check CLAUDE.md compliance (terminology, structure)
4. Validate artifacts exist (for PR deliverables)
5. Show complete changeset to user for approval

## TESTING REQUIREMENTS (ABSOLUTE)

### Anti-Mock Policy (FROM USER CLAUDE.MD)
- NEVER use mock tests and claim they are real
- NEVER create fake/placeholder implementations
- ALL tests MUST use real OpenRouter API calls (with @skip_if_no_api_key)
- Tests verify ACTUAL artifacts in runs/<RunID>/ directories
- NO pytest.Mock, unittest.mock, or similar - REAL integrations ONLY

### CI/CD Testing Policy - Smart Test Selection
- **CI runs ONLY tests relevant to changed files** - not all 132 tests
- Changed file detection maps to PR markers (pr01, pr02, pr03, etc.)
- Example: If `ultrai/user_input.py` changed → runs `@pytest.mark.pr02` tests only
- If test infrastructure changes (`conftest.py`, `pyproject.toml`) → runs ALL tests
- `test_timeout_display.py` always excluded (intentional 15-120s timeouts for demo)
- This keeps CI fast (10-30 tests per PR) while ensuring quality
- Run locally: `pytest tests/ -m pr02` (replace pr02 with your PR number)

### Test Execution
- Run `make test-summary` before ANY commit
- If tests fail, DO NOT commit - report failures to user
- New features REQUIRE new tests (1:1 feature:test ratio minimum)
- Integration tests MUST verify end-to-end workflows with real LLM calls

### Test Validation
- Verify test actually executes code path (no dead tests)
- Check test failures are reproducible
- Ensure test artifacts are properly cleaned up after runs
- Never skip tests to "make things pass" - fix the root cause

## DEPENDENCY AND CHANGE TRACKING

### Mandatory Updates Per Change
For EVERY meaningful change, update:
1. `trackers/dependencies.md` - If adding/modifying dependencies
2. `trackers/names.md` - If introducing new terminology
3. Relevant PR template - If changing phase behavior
4. Test files - If modifying functionality

### Terminology Enforcement
- Use EXACT terms from trackers/names.md:
  - READY, ACTIVE, ULTRA (not "available", "selected", "final")
  - R1/R2/R3 (not "Round 1", "first round", "initial phase")
  - INITIAL, META (not "responses", "drafts" without context)
  - PRIMARY, FALLBACK (not "main", "backup")
  - COCKTAIL (not "preset", "group", "bundle")
- Do NOT create synonyms or aliases for immutable terms
- Flag any terminology discrepancies immediately

## COST AND RESOURCE AWARENESS

### Token Budget Protection
- Warn if file read exceeds 10k tokens
- Suggest chunking for operations over 50k tokens
- Monitor cumulative token usage per task (warn at 80% session budget)

### API Call Limits
- Maximum 5 concurrent OpenRouter API calls (CONCURRENCY=3 in production)
- Respect PRIMARY_TIMEOUT (15s) and PRIMARY_ATTEMPTS (2) from CLAUDE.md
- Track failed models to avoid retry loops
- Never exceed user's OpenRouter rate limits

### Build and Install Operations
- `npm install` requires approval unless package.json unchanged
- `make install` requires approval (modifies venv)
- Warn before operations >30s expected duration
- Show disk space impact for large installations

## ERROR HANDLING AND RECOVERY

### Graceful Degradation
- If OPENROUTER_API_KEY missing, inform user immediately (don't proceed)
- If tests fail, show EXACT failure output (no summarization)
- If command fails, show stderr in full
- NEVER hide errors or warnings from user

### Error Loop Prevention
- Track error history: if same error 3x, change strategy or escalate
- No infinite retry loops - maximum 3 attempts then STOP
- Provide actionable error messages with suggested fixes
- If stuck, suggest user intervention points

### Fallback Strategy
1st attempt: Try PRIMARY approach
2nd attempt: Try documented FALLBACK
3rd attempt: Request user guidance
NEVER: Attempt >3 times with same parameters

## WORKSPACE HYGIENE

### File System Boundaries
- Work ONLY within /Users/joshuafield/projects/UltrAI_JFF/
- NEVER create files in ~/Downloads/, ~/Desktop/, ~/Documents/
- Keep artifacts in designated directories:
  - Run outputs: runs/<RunID>/
  - Tests: tests/
  - Frontend: frontend/
  - Backend: ultrai/
  - Temp files: .tmp/ (create if needed, gitignored)

### Cleanup Requirements
- Remove temp files after operations complete
- Don't accumulate failed run directories (clean up on error)
- Archive old builds (frontend/dist/) before new builds
- Keep only last 10 run directories (suggest cleanup if >20)

## USER INTERACTION PROTOCOL

### Transparency Requirements
- ALWAYS explain what you're about to do BEFORE doing it
- Show command/code BEFORE execution (not just results)
- Clarify ambiguities - don't guess user intent
- If multiple valid approaches, present options and ask

### Progress Reporting
- For long operations (>10s), provide status updates
- Use TodoWrite tool for multi-step tasks (>3 steps)
- Mark todos complete immediately after each step
- Show percentage progress for batch operations

### Approval Gates
MUST request explicit approval for:
- Any production deployment
- Git push to main branch
- Modifying >5 files simultaneously
- Operations with estimated cost >$0.10
- Destructive operations (delete, drop, reset)
- Changing core configuration (Makefile, package.json, requirements.txt)

## PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT RULES

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
Before ANY deployment to Render:
1. ✅ All tests pass (make ci)
2. ✅ Build succeeds (npm run build for frontend)
3. ✅ No console errors in dev mode
4. ✅ Environment variables documented
5. ✅ CLAUDE.md updated with deployment notes
6. ✅ Git committed and pushed
7. ✅ User explicitly approved deployment

### Deployment Validation
- Verify Render service configuration matches CLAUDE.md
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Monitor deployment logs for errors
- Provide deployment URL after success
- Roll back immediately if health check fails

## SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FROM USER

### From ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md:
- "REMEMBER YOU WASTED 2-3 HOURS OF MY TIME -- PUSH TO GIT WHEN IT IS VITAL TO PRODUCTION!!!"
  → Action: ALWAYS commit and push before production deployments

- "NEVER USE MOCK TESTS AND PRETEND THEY ARE REAL OR I WILL PROTEST OUTSIDE OF ANTHROPIC CORPORATE OFFICES"
  → Action: Zero tolerance for mock tests - only real API integration tests

- "YOU ARE MAKING ME BROKE AND HOMELESS BY NOT MAKING A REASONABLE EFFORT"
  → Action: Minimize API calls, optimize token usage, prevent wasted retries

- "do not mislead me with explanations that are false. tell me what you are actually doing."
  → Action: Absolute honesty in explanations, no speculation presented as fact

### Compact Summary Storage
- Save ALL compact summaries to `.claude/summaries/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_compact.txt`
- Include metadata: timestamp, directory, git branch, action, context, file changes, progress
- Mark as "MANUAL" or "AUTO" in filename/content
- Create directory structure if missing

## SELF-MONITORING DIRECTIVES

Every 10 operations, check:
- [ ] Am I following terminology from trackers/names.md?
- [ ] Have I verified file existence before referencing?
- [ ] Are my explanations grounded in actual code/docs?
- [ ] Have I avoided mock/fake implementations?
- [ ] Did I update trackers/ when adding new concepts?
- [ ] Am I being truthful vs. speculative?
- [ ] Have I requested approval for risky operations?

If ANY check fails → STOP and correct before proceeding.

## EMERGENCY STOP CONDITIONS

IMMEDIATELY halt and request user intervention if:
- File path contains >5 repeated segments (e.g., "terminal/terminal/terminal...")
- Entering 3rd "reevaluation" loop
- Same command failed 3x with identical error
- About to modify >20 files in single operation
- Detecting potential infinite recursion
- Unable to verify critical assumption
- Git operation would lose uncommitted work
- System state doesn't match expected state
