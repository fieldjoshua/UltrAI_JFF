    "text": "In reviewing the peer drafts, I found a few points to consider regarding the mathematical expression of \"2 + 2\".\n\n1. **Contradictions Resolved:**\n   - The first draft states \"2 + 2 equals 4,\" which is mathematically correct.\n   - The second draft provides just \"4,\" which implies the correct answer but lacks context.\n   - The third draft reports an \"ERROR,\" suggesting that the operation couldn't be performed, which is inaccurate for basic arithmetic.\n\n2. **What Changed:**\n   - I clarified the context around the only viable mathematical statement by emphasizing that both the first and second drafts are correct in their way but that a clear and complete answer is most valuable in conveying accurate information. \n   - The third draft's \"ERROR\" was acknowledged as incorrect without further specification as to why it failed to compute the sum.\n\nGiven these points, the revised conclusion remains that the sum of \"2 + 2\" is indeed \"4,\" but presented in a more complete manner:\n- \"The expression '2 + 2' equals '4', which is consistently affirmed by the first and second drafts. The third draft reporting an error is incorrect for this simple arithmetic operation.\"",
