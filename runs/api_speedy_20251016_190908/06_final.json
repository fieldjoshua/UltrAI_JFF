  "text": "The consensus from the reviewed drafts confirms that the mathematical expression \"2 + 2\" equals \"4.\" \n\n1. **Draft Analysis:**\n   - The first draft states, \"2 + 2 equals 4,\" which is accurate.\n   - The second draft simply provides \"4,\" implying the correct answer without additional context.\n   - The third draft reports an \"ERROR,\" which is incorrect, as basic arithmetic confirms that this operation can be performed.\n\n2. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given these points, the reliable response is: \"2 + 2 = 4.\" This conclusion is supported by both the first and second drafts while noting that the third draft's claim of an error is invalid in the context of simple arithmetic.\n\nIn summary, the synthesized answer is clear: **2 + 2 = 4**.",
