  "text": "The question posed was \"What is 2 + 2?\". The responses reviewed from multiple LLM models indicate a consensus on the correct answer.\n\nBoth openai/gpt-4o-mini and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku agree that 2 + 2 equals 4. This is a standard mathematical fact and reflects accurate calculations from these models. Meanwhile, google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp provided an \"ERROR\" response, which does not align with the others and suggests a possible processing error rather than a mathematical contradiction.\n\nIn conclusion, the reliable responses confirm that 2 + 2 equals 4, whereas the \"ERROR\" from google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp indicates a limitation or issue within that specific model. The synthesis retains the correct information from the reliable sources while noting the outlier as an error.\n\n**Confidence Notes**: The conclusions drawn are based on the consistent agreement between two of the models, leading to high confidence in the accuracy of the answer provided.\n\n**Basic Stats**:\n- Reliable Responses: 2 (openai/gpt-4o-mini, anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku)\n- Outlier Response: 1 (google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp)",
