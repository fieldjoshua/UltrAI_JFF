  "text": "Synthesis of META drafts:\n\nThe responses from the models indicate that the calculation of 2 + 2 yields a result of 4. Both \"openai/gpt-4o-mini\" and \"anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku\" consistently affirm that 2 + 2 equals 4. The \"google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp\" model, however, reported an error without offering a valid calculation, which does not counter the correct responses but indicates a flaw in that modelâ€™s output.\n\n**Final Coherent Response:**\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n**Confidence Notes:**\n- The consensus from two models establishes the correctness of the arithmetic statement.\n- The error noted in the Google model does not disrupt the consistency of answers provided by the other models.\n\n**Basic Stats:**\n- Retained claims: \"2 + 2 equals 4\" from two models.\n- Omitted claims: The error from the Google model was acknowledged but did not provide any meaningful counter or alternative answer.",
