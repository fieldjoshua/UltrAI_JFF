    "text": "Based on the peer drafts provided, here is a summary of contradictions resolved and changes made:\n\n1. **Initialization of the Peers' Responses:**\n   - Both \"openai/gpt-4o-mini\" and \"anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku\" agreed on the simple arithmetic proposition that 2 + 2 equals 4.\n   - However, \"google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free\" indicated an ERROR without specifying what the error entailed.\n\n2. **Contradictions Resolved:**\n   - There were no direct contradictions between the two valid responses (from OpenAI and Anthropic); they both were consistent in stating that 2 + 2 equals 4. The draft from Google, indicating an ERROR, suggests an issue but does not provide a clear counter to the other responses.\n\n3. **Changes Made:**\n   - The lack of a reliable answer from the Google draft might necessitate an acknowledgment of its error without dismissing the correct answers provided by OpenAI and Anthropic.\n   - A clear summary that emphasizes the agreement of the correct mathematical statement (2 + 2 equals 4) and notes the occurrence of the error in the Google draft is critical for clarity.\n\n**Revised Summary:**\nBoth \"openai/gpt-4o-mini\" and \"anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku\" state that 2 + 2 equals 4, which is a correct and consistent answer. The response from \"google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free\" shows an ERROR, indicating a failure in response generation without conflicting with the valid answers. \n\nThis revision aims to provide clarity on the consensus regarding the arithmetic operation while acknowledging the error from the Google model.",
