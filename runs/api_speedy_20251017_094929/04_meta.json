For clarity and consistency, I decided to standardize the format.\n   \n**Changes Made**:\n- I revised the answer to clearly state: \"2 + 2 equals 4,\" aligning with the clarity of presentation in the first draft while retaining the core mathematical truth acknowledged in the second.\n- I addressed the \"ERROR\" in the third draft by acknowledging it but not incorporating it into the final answer since it did not contribute to the arithmetic context.\n\n**Final Output**: \"2 + 2 equals 4.\" \n\nThis format maintains clarity and correctness while addressing the discrepancies noted in the peer drafts.",
