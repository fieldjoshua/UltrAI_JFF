  "text": "The correct answer to the question \"What is 2 + 2?\" is 4. This conclusion is supported by the responses from both the openai and anthropic drafts, which consistently affirm that 2 + 2 equals 4. However, the google draft reported an ERROR, indicating a failure to compute the sum correctly, which reflects an inconsistency with the other two responses. Therefore, we can confidently state that the mathematical operation results in 4, while noting that the google draft is unreliable due to its computational error.\n\nConfidence Notes: The consistency between openai and anthropic drafts reinforces the correctness of the answer. The discrepancy from the google draft introduces uncertainty regarding its accuracy. \n\nBasic Stats: \n- 2 drafts confirmed the answer as 4.\n- 1 draft returned an ERROR.",
