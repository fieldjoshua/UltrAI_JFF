    "text": "In reviewing the peer drafts, I noticed the following contradictions and made necessary changes:\n\n1. **Contradiction on Addition Result:**\n   - The draft from openai states that \"2 + 2 equals 4.\"\n   - The draft from anthropic simply states \"4,\" which is in agreement with the openai draft but lacks any explanation.\n   - There is no direct contradiction here, but the anthropic draft is not as informative as the openai's.\n\n2. **Error in Calculation:**\n   - The google draft reports an \"ERROR,\" indicating a failure to compute the sum accurately.\n   - This stands in contrast to the other two drafts that provide a correct answer.\n\n**Changes Made:**\n- I decided to keep the information from openai, which gives a clear equation along with its result.\n- I adjusted the overall summary to emphasize the correctness of 2 + 2 equalling 4, while highlighting the ERROR from the google draft as a failure to resolve the mathematical operation.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n- The correct answer to \"2 + 2\" is consistently presented as \"4,\" confirmed by openai and indirectly supported by anthropic. The google draft represents a computational error, which is a notable inconsistency compared to the other responses. \n\nThis review process resulted in reinforcing the correct mathematical conclusion while clarifying the discrepancies in peer responses.",
