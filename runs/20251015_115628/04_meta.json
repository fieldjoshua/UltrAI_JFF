    "text": "### Revised Answer\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n***\n\n### Contradictions Resolved & Changes Made\n\n1.  **Contradiction: Valid Numerical Answer vs. System Error.**\n    *   **Issue:** Three peers (`anthropic`, `google`, `openai`) provided a response that converged on the numerical result of 4. One peer (`unknown`) returned an `ERROR`. This is a direct contradiction between providing a valid answer and failing to respond.\n    *   **Resolution:** The `ERROR` response was treated as a system failure or corrupted data and was discarded. The revised answer is based on the consensus of the three peers that provided a valid, parseable response.\n\n2.  **Inconsistency: Completeness of Response.**\n    *   **Issue:** The `anthropic` and `google` drafts provided the full equation (`2 + 2 = 4`), while the `openai` draft provided only the result (`4`).\n    *   **Resolution:** The revised answer adopted the more complete format (`2 + 2 = 4`). This format is superior as it provides full context by restating the original problem alongside the solution.\n\n3.  **Inconsistency: Punctuation.**\n    *   **Issue:** The `google` draft (`2 + 2 = 4.`) included a terminal period, while the `anthropic` draft (`2 + 2 = 4`) did not.\n    *   **Resolution:** The terminal period was omitted in the revised answer. For a standalone mathematical equation, omitting extraneous punctuation is the cleaner and more conventional format.",

    "text": "Answer: 2 + 2 = 4\n\nIndependent verification:\n- By counting: start at 2 and count two more steps (3, 4) → 4.\n- By standard arithmetic over the natural/integers, addition of 2 and 2 yields 4.\n\nContradictions resolved:\n- The “unknown: ERROR” entry contradicts the valid numeric result. Resolved by independently recomputing the sum; treat “ERROR” as a failed computation, not an alternate answer.\n- Minor format differences (“2 + 2 = 4”, “4.”, “4”) are not logical contradictions; they all convey the same value.\n\nWhat changed in this revision:\n- Normalized the output to the explicit equation form “2 + 2 = 4” for clarity.\n- Added a brief independent check instead of relying on any peer response.\n- Explicitly documented the handling of the “ERROR” peer entry and clarified that formatting differences do not affect the result.",
