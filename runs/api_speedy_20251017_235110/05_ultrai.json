  "text": "The question \"What is 2 + 2?\" has received responses from multiple models. The majority consensus among them confirms that the answer is 4. Both the openai/gpt-4o-mini and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku drafts straightforwardly state that 2 + 2 equals 4. In contrast, the google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp model produced an error in response, which does not contribute to the mathematical reasoning.\n\nIn summary, the reliable and universally accepted answer to the question is 2 + 2 = 4. The error from the google model indicates a failure to compute correctly but does not reflect the correct mathematical outcome. \n\nConfidence notes: The synthesis is based on a clear consensus from two valid responses while acknowledging the discrepancy with the third. No significant contradictions were found among the functional models, and the error identified in the google model does not undermine the validity of the answer.",
