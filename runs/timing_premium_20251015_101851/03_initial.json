    "text": "Timing benchmarks for cocktail preparation can vary based on the complexity of the drink, the skill of the bartender, and the workflow of the bar. However, here are some general guidelines for how long it might take to prepare different types of cocktails:\n\n1. **Simple Cocktails (1-2 ingredients)**: \n   - Examples: Gin & Tonic, Rum & Coke, Vodka Soda.\n   - Time: 30 seconds to 1 minute.\n   - These drinks usually require just pouring and a quick stir or adding a garnish.\n\n2. **Classic Cocktails (3-5 ingredients)**:\n   - Examples: Martini, Manhattan, Margarita, Old Fashioned.\n   - Time: 1 to 3 minutes.\n   - These often involve measuring, stirring or shaking, and proper garnishing.\n\n3. **Complex Cocktails (5+ ingredients or specialized techniques)**:\n   - Examples: Mojito, Mai Tai, Ramos Gin Fizz.\n   - Time: 3 to 5 minutes.\n   - These may require muddling, layering, multiple techniques, or longer shaking/stirring times.\n\n4. **Signature or Craft Cocktails**:\n   - Time: 5 to 10 minutes.\n   - These involve bespoke ingredients or garnishes, and precise techniques to enhance presentation and flavor.\n\n**Tips for Efficient Cocktail Preparation:**\n\n- **Mise en Place**: Have all ingredients, tools, and glassware ready before starting.\n- **Batching**: Pre-batch ingredients when possible to speed up service, especially for popular cocktails.\n- **Practice**: Regular practice helps reduce preparation times without sacrificing quality.\n- **Use Tools Wisely**: Utilize jiggers for precise measurements and opt for equipment like speed pourers.\n\nThese benchmarks can help in training bartenders and managing customer expectations during busy service times. Adjust as needed based on the specifics of the bar environment and any custom processes involved.",
