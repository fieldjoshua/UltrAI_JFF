This does not reflect the total cost of formation as state fees will always be required.\n*   **Basic Tier Total:** The total cost of the basic LLC formation package including their service fee and the estimated first-year registered agent cost (if it's not already included or is discounted for the first year) *before* state filing fees. If Registered Agent is not included, this is just the basic service cost plus state filing fees.\n*   **Mid Tier Total:** The total cost of the mid-tier LLC formation package including their service fee and the estimated first-year registered agent cost (if it's not already included or is discounted for the first year) *before* state filing fees. Not all services have a mid tier.\n*   **Premium Tier Total:** The total cost of the premium LLC formation package including their service fee and the estimated first-year registered agent cost (if it's not already included or is discounted for the first year) *before* state filing fees.  Not all services have a premium tier.\n*   **Registered Agent (Yr 1):** The annual cost of Registered Agent service for the *first* year.\n*   **Operating Agreement:** Indicates whether an operating agreement is included in at least one tier, or if it is available as a template (or must be purchased separately).\n*   **EIN Included:**  Indicates whether an Employer Identification Number (EIN) application is included in at least one tier of service.\n*   **Positive Differentiation:** What makes this service stand out positively from competitors.\n*   **Negative Differentiation:** potential downsides, such as upsells, cost, or reputation.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **State Fees:**  The CSV does **not** include California's state filing fees. You MUST add these to any \"Total\" calculated in the CSV to get the true cost.\n*   **Registered Agent:**  I've included the *first* year registered agent cost to give a more accurate immediate cost comparison. Registered Agent costs can and will occur after the first year.\n*   **Pricing Fluctuations:** Pricing and included features can change frequently.  Always check the provider's website for the latest.\n*   **Personal Needs:** This is a *general* comparison. The \"best\" service depends entirely on your specific needs and budget.  Consider what features are most important to you.\n*   **Research:** Read reviews from multiple sources before making a decision.\n*   **N/A:** I've used \"N/A\" to indicate \"Not Applicable\" or \"Not Available\" in cases where a company does not have a specific feature or tier. Also, rocket lawyer is using a free trail/subscription model. Registered Agent is not part of their main incorporation service so it is N/A.\n*   **Legal Advice:** *This is not legal advice.* Consult with an attorney or financial advisor for personalized guidance.\n*   **Bizee:** Formerly \"Incorporate.com\". Has similar features and pricing as Incfile and ZenBusiness.\n\n**How to use this .CSV file:**\n\n1.  **Save:** Copy the text above and paste it into a plain text file.\n2.  **Rename:** Rename the file to something like `llc_comparison.csv`.  Make sure the `.csv` extension is used.\n3.  **Open:** Open the `.csv` file with a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc, or similar.\n\nThis will present the data in a organized table, making it easy to sort, filter, and compare the services. Good luck with your LLC formation!\n",
