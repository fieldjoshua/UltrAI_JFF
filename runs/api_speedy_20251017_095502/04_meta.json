Unified mathematical representation\n2. Eliminated the non-standard \"ERROR\" response\n\nRecommended Final Draft:\n\"2 + 2 = 4\"\n\nRationale:\n- Mathematically verifiable\n- Matches majority consensus\n- Provides clear, unambiguous answer\n\nRevision Notes:\n- Minimal changes required\n- Standardized notation\n- Removed non-informative response\n\nConfidence Level: High ✓",
