    "text": "After reviewing the peer drafts, here are the contradictions I resolved and the changes made:\n\n### Resolved Contradictions:\n1. **Generic Consistency**: Both openai/gpt-4o-mini and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku stated that 2 + 2 equals 4, providing a consistent mathematical conclusion. The google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp draft stated \"ERROR\" without providing a coherent mathematical statement regarding 2 + 2. This lack of clarity contrasts with the other drafts, which confirm the basic mathematical truth.\n\n### Changes Made:\n- **Clarification of Accurate Responses**: I recognized that both openai and anthropic drafts correctly confirmed that 2 + 2 equals 4, which should be the standard answer highlighted for accuracy.\n- **Omission of ERROR**: I chose not to include the \"ERROR\" response from google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp in my summary, as it does not contribute to an understanding of the mathematical statement and lacks correctness.\n\n### Revised Summary:\nBoth openai/gpt-4o-mini and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku accurately affirm that 2 + 2 equals 4, while the google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp draft fails to provide a valid mathematical conclusion.",
