  "text": "# Cocktail Timing Benchmark\n\nBased on synthesizing the available META drafts, here's a comprehensive guide for establishing timing benchmarks for cocktail preparation:\n\n## Standard Preparation Times by Cocktail Type\n\n| Cocktail Type | Preparation Time | Examples |\n|--------------|------------------|----------|\n| Built cocktails | 20-30 seconds | Highball, Gin & Tonic, Rum & Coke |\n| Stirred cocktails | 60-90 seconds | Manhattan, Negroni, Old Fashioned |\n| Shaken cocktails | 30-45 seconds | Daiquiri, Margarita, Cosmopolitan |\n| Muddled cocktails | 90-120 seconds | Mojito, Caipirinha |\n\n## Complexity Categories\n\n- **Simple Cocktails** (2-3 ingredients): 30 seconds to 1 minute\n  - Examples: Gin & Tonic, Rum & Coke\n  \n- **Classic Cocktails** (4-5 ingredients): 1-2 minutes\n  - Examples: Margarita, Negroni, Old Fashioned\n  \n- **Craft Cocktails** (5+ ingredients): 2-3+ minutes\n  - Examples: Mojito, Caipirinha\n\n## Component Breakdown\n\n| Component | Time |\n|-----------|------|\n| Measuring ingredients | 10-15 seconds per ingredient |\n| Stirring | 30-45 seconds |\n| Shaking | 10-15 seconds |\n| Muddling | 20-30 seconds |\n| Garnishing | 10-20 seconds |\n| Ice preparation | 5-10 seconds |\n\n## How to Conduct Your Own Benchmark\n\n1. **Preparation Time**\n   - Ingredient setup and mise en place\n   - Glassware preparation\n\n2. **Execution Time**\n   - Measuring ingredients\n   - Mixing method (stirring, shaking, building, muddling)\n   - Straining\n\n3. **Finishing Time**\n   - Garnishing\n   - Final presentation\n\n4. **Total Time**\n   - Sum of all steps from start to finish\n\n## Tips for Improving Efficiency\n- Organize your workstation with frequently used ingredients within reach\n- Prepare garnishes in advance during slow periods\n- Practice standard recipes until you develop muscle memory\n- Consider batch preparation for high-volume ingredients\n\n---\n\n**Synthesis Notes:**\n- I incorporated the classification systems from both Anthropic and Meta drafts, as they were complementary rather than contradictory\n- All models agreed on the general timing ranges for different complexity levels\n- Component breakdown was primarily from Anthropic's draft, as it provided specific timing details\n- The \"How to Conduct\" section was consistent across drafts that mentioned methodology\n- Omitted Google's draft as it returned an error\n- No significant contradictions were found between the OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta drafts on timing estimates",
