  "text": "Based on the synthesis of the META drafts, here is a coherent response to the user's query \"Test query\":\n\n---\n\nHello! It seems you're testing the query functionality. While the METAs reviewed focused on a welcoming tone, there were some inconsistencies among the drafts. Specifically, some emphasized a desire to assist while others encountered error states without providing clear engagement.\n\nTo provide clarity and encourage interaction, here's a refined invitation for you: \"How can I assist you today? If you have any questions or topics you'd like to discuss, feel free to ask!\"\n\nThis response aims to combine a warm welcome with an invitation for further engagement, while maintaining clarity without technical jargon.\n\n---\n\n**Confidence Notes:**\n- Retained the welcoming tone from openai and anthropic drafts, omitting references to errors from Google's draft for clarity.\n- Addressed the intent of improving engagement based on peer reviews while avoiding generic responses.\n- Maintained a focus on inviting further interaction to ensure user engagement.",
