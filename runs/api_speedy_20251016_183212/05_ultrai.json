Consequently, I am unable to synthesize a coherent answer based on the available information. \n\nGiven this situation, the direct mathematical answer to the user's query \"What is 2+2?\" is simply 4. However, this answer does not derive from the META drafts since they did not contain usable content. \n\nConfidence Note: High for the numerical response of 4, but low for synthesis from the drafts due to errors. \nBasic Stats: 2 drafts reviewed, both resulted in ERROR.",
