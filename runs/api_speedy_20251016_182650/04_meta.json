    "text": "Upon reviewing the peer drafts, I found the following:\n\n1. **Contradiction in Mathematical Assertions**: \n   - The first draft states that \"2 + 2 equals 4,\" which is correct and aligns with general mathematical principles.\n   - The second draft simply states \"4.\" While it is also correct, it lacks context regarding how it arrived at that answer.\n   - The third draft indicates \"ERROR,\" which suggests a failure to compute or report an expected result. This contradicts the accurate mathematical assertions found in the first two drafts.\n\n**Resolution and Changes Made**:\n- I clarified that the correct answer to the expression \"2 + 2\" is indeed \"4\" and highlighted the inconsistencies in the other drafts.\n- I did not change the factual answer since \"4\" is the accurate result, but I noted the failure in the third draft and emphasized the correctness of the first two drafts.\n\nOverall, my response emphasizes the accuracy of the mathematical computation while identifying and resolving contradictions in the peer drafts.",
