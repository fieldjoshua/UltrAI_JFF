  "text": "The answer to the query \"What is 2+2?\" is that 2 + 2 equals 4. This conclusion is supported by multiple drafts, where one states, \"2 + 2 equals 4,\" and another simply confirms this with the numerical response \"4.\" These two responses indicate a clear consensus on the correct outcome. \n\nHowever, one draft presented an \"ERROR,\" which does not provide a coherent answer and is unrelated to the correctness of the mathematical statement. Therefore, it is excluded from the final synthesis.\n\nIn summary, the coherent response is: \n\n\"2 + 2 = 4, demonstrating basic arithmetic addition.\" \n\nConfidence Level: High, as the majority of drafts align accurately with the mathematical statement.",
