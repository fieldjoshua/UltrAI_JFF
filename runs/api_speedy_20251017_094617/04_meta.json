This aligns with the second draft that simply states \"4.\" Thereâ€™s no contradiction here, as both agree on the outcome.\n2. **Error in Final Draft**: The third draft mentions \"ERROR,\" which may imply an issue with computation or response. This does not provide a clear answer or context, contrasting with the other drafts.\n\n### Changes Made:\n- **Consolidated Responses**: The response that simply states \"4\" is accurate and confirms the correctness provided in the first draft.\n- **Acknowledged Error**: I noted that the third draft suggests an error but does not contradict the numerical correctness established in the first two drafts.\n\n### Revised Conclusion:\nAs a result, the consensus is that 2 + 2 equals 4 based on the first two drafts, while the third draft's \"ERROR\" is a separate issue that does not affect the correctness of the equation itself.",

    "text": "I understand that I'm in a META revision round (R2) for reviewing peer drafts on a simple mathematical statement. I'll carefully analyze each draft and note potential issues.\n\nDRAFT ANALYSIS:\n1. openai/gpt-4o-mini: \"2 + 2 equals 4\"\n   - Seems like a straightforward, mathematically correct statement\n   - No apparent contradiction\n\n2. anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku: \"4\"\n   - Very concise response\n   - Appears to be the numeric result of 2 + 2\n   - Technically correct, but lacks explanation\n\n3. google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free: \"ERROR\"\n   - Anomalous response\n   - Suggests a potential system or processing error\n   - Not a meaningful mathematical statement\n\nRESOLUTION:\n- No significant contradictions found\n- All drafts (except the error) converge on \"2 + 2 = 4\"\n\nCHANGES:\n- No substantial revisions needed\n- Recommendation: Standardize response format for clarity\n\nRECOMMENDED STANDARD RESPONSE:\n\"2 + 2 = 4, demonstrating basic arithmetic addition.\"",
