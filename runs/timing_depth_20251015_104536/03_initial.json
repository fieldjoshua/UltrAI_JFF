    "text": "Timing benchmarks for cocktails refer to the average time it takes to prepare and serve specific drinks. This can vary depending on the complexity of the cocktail, the bartender's skill level, and the bar's setup. Here's a general guideline for some common cocktails:\n\n1. **Simple Cocktails (1-2 minutes):**\n   - **Gin and Tonic:** Quick assembly, involves pouring and adding garnish.\n   - **Moscow Mule:** Combine ingredients and serve in a copper mug.\n   - **Rum and Coke:** Mix ingredients and serve over ice.\n\n2. **Intermediate Cocktails (3-5 minutes):**\n   - **Margarita:** Requires preparation like shaking and salting the rim.\n   - **Daiquiri:** Shaking of ingredients and pouring.\n   - **Old Fashioned:** Muddling required, but generally quick.\n\n3. **Complex Cocktails (5-8 minutes):**\n   - **Mojito:** Involves muddling mint leaves and other steps.\n   - **Pisco Sour:** Shaking with egg whites can take additional time.\n   - **Manhattan or Negroni:** Stirring and straining can be time-consuming.\n\n4. **Specialty or Craft Cocktails (8+ minutes):**\n   - These can involve multiple steps, such as infusions, special garnishes, or unique presentations. The time can vary significantly based on the recipe.\n\nTo improve timing benchmarks:\n\n- **Preparation:** Ensure all ingredients and tools are organized and readily accessible.\n- **Practice:** Improve efficiency and muscle memory through regular practice.\n- **Batching:** Pre-batch certain elements to reduce preparation time during service.\n\nRemember that consistent quality should not be sacrificed for speed, as the presentation and taste of the cocktail are crucial for customer satisfaction.",
