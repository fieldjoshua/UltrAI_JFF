I have resolved this contradiction and included specific time benchmarks for each category for a more cohesive answer.",

    "text": "After reviewing the peer drafts, I have identified some inconsistencies and areas that require revision. Here's my revised response:\n\nWhile there isn't a universal timing benchmark for preparing cocktails, as it largely depends on the drink's complexity and the bartender's skill level, some general guidelines can be established. \n\nA more detailed breakdown of preparation times for various cocktails can be provided:\n\n**Simple Cocktails (2-3 ingredients)** typically take around 30 seconds to 1 minute to prepare, examples include:\n1. Gin & Tonic\n2. Rum & Coke\n3. Vodka Soda\n\n**Classic Cocktails (4-5 ingredients)** usually require 1-2 minutes to prepare, examples include:\n1. Old Fashioned\n2. Daiquiri\n3. Margarita\n4. Manhattan\n5. Martini\n\n**Complex Cocktails (6-8 ingredients)** may take 2-3 minutes to prepare, examples include:\n1. Mai Tai\n2. Pimm's Cup\n3. Mojito\n\nContradictions resolved:\n1. **Lack of specificity**: The initial draft from openai/gpt-3.5-turbo provided a broad estimate of 1-3 minutes for most cocktails. However, the meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct draft offered a more detailed breakdown of preparation times for different types of cocktails, which I have incorporated into my revised response.\n2. **Inconsistent information**: The google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free and qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct drafts contained errors, which I have disregarded in favor of more reliable information from the other drafts.\n3. **Generalized vs. specific guidelines**: My revised response aims to strike a balance between providing general guidelines and offering more specific examples of preparation times for various cocktails.\n\nChanges made:\n1. **Incorporation of specific examples**: I have added specific examples of cocktails and their corresponding preparation times to provide a more detailed understanding of the timing involved.\n2. **Categorization of cocktails**: I have categorized cocktails into simple, classic, and complex to help organize the information and make it easier to understand.\n3. **Exclusion of erroneous information**: I have disregarded the drafts containing errors and focused on the more reliable information provided by the other drafts.",
