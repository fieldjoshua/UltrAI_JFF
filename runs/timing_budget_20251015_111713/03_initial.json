    "text": "There is no set timing benchmark for cocktails as the preparation time can vary depending on the complexity of the drink and the skill level of the bartender. However, a general rule of thumb is that most cocktails should take between 1-3 minutes to make, not including the time it takes to gather ingredients and set up the bar station. More intricate cocktails that involve muddling, shaking, or layering may take longer to prepare. Ultimately, the focus should be on ensuring that each cocktail is made with care and attention to detail rather than rushing through the process.",
