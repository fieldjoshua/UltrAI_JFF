    "text": "In reviewing the peer drafts, I noted some contradictions and inconsistencies regarding the responses to the question \"What is 2 + 2?\". Here's how I revised my answer based on these drafts:\n\n### Contradictions Resolved:\n\n1. **Numerical Consistency**: \n   - The first draft (openai/gpt-4o-mini) asserts that \"2 + 2 equals 4,\" which is mathematically accurate.\n   - The second draft (anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku) simply states \"4,\" which is also correct but lacks context.\n   - The third draft (google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free) indicates an \"ERROR,\" which is a contradiction because it fails to provide a valid mathematical answer.\n\n### Changes Made:\n- **Clarification**: I emphasized the correct answer and acknowledged the valid responses while addressing the error in the third draft.\n- **Consolidation**: I integrated the accurate responses into a cohesive summary.\n\n### Revised Answer:\nThe correct answer to \"2 + 2\" is 4, as confirmed by both openai/gpt-4o-mini and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku. The response from google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free indicates an error, which should not detract from the mathematical correctness of the query. Thus, the final statement remains that 2 + 2 equals 4.",

Calculation: 2 + 2 = 4 (verified across multiple sources)\n2. Error from Google/Gemini draft may indicate system/parsing issue\n\nCONTRADICTION RESOLUTION:\n- All non-error responses converge on answer\n- Google draft requires further investigation for technical reason\n\nCHANGES FROM INITIAL REVIEW:\n- Maintained core mathematical conclusion\n- Noted potential technical limitation in one source\n- Recommended verification of Google draft's technical status\n\nCONFIDENCE LEVEL: High (>95% for mathematical accuracy)\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\n- Proceed with \"4\" as standard answer\n- Flag Google draft for technical review\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this review?",
