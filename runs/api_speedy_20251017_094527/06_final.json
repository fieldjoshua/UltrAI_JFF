  "text": "The correct answer to the question \"What is 2 + 2?\" is 4. This conclusion is consistently supported by multiple drafts, particularly from openai/gpt-4o-mini and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku, which confirm that 2 + 2 equals 4. However, the response from google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free indicates an error, which does not affect the overall correctness of the mathematical expression. Thus, despite this error, the mathematically accurate result remains that 2 + 2 equals 4.\n\n**Confidence Level:** High (>95% for mathematical accuracy)  \n**Meta Drafts Retained:** OpenAI draft (correct answer), Anthropic draft (correct answer), Google draft (noted error).  \n**Meta Drafts Omitted:** Incorrect or inconsistent references regarding the error without valid mathematical outputs.",
