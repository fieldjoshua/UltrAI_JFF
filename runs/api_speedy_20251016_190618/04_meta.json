The equation 2 + 2 is a simple arithmetic operation, and its result is indeed 4.\n\nContradictions resolved:\n- The lack of a clear equation in anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku is resolved by assuming it implies the result of 2 + 2.\n- The ERROR returned by google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free is disregarded due to its lack of relevance to the mathematical equation.\n\nChanges:\n- My initial answer would have been uncertain due to the incomplete information from peer drafts.\n- After reviewing and resolving the contradictions, I can confidently state that 2 + 2 = 4.",
