  "text": "The answer to the question \"What is 2 + 2?\" is 4. This conclusion is supported by multiple model drafts that agree on the result of the mathematical equation. Specifically, the model meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct provides a clear calculation showing that 2 + 2 equals 4, while anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku directly states \"4,\" indicating agreement with this result. \n\nThe google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free draft returned an error, which is not relevant to answering the query. Therefore, it is disregarded in this context.\n\nIn summary, the consensus from the reviewed models confirms that 2 + 2 = 4, with no contradictions in the responses retained. \n\n### Confidence Notes:\n- High confidence in the result as it is supported by multiple drafts.\n- ERROR response from one draft is omitted as it does not contribute to the answer.\n\n### Basic Stats:\n- Total drafts reviewed: 3\n- Drafts supporting \"2 + 2 = 4\": 2\n- Drafts providing non-contributory information (ERROR): 1",
