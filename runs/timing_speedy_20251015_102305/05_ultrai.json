  "text": "### Synthesis of Cocktail Preparation Timing\n\nAfter reviewing the META drafts, the following convergent points and resolved contradictions form the basis of this synthesis:\n\n1. **Shaking Cocktails**: A shaking time of 15-20 seconds is referenced by openai/gpt-4o-mini, which will be used as a guideline.\n2. **Stirring Cocktails**: Stirring typically takes longer than shaking, with a time frame of 30-45 seconds as suggested by openai/gpt-4o-mini, aligning with spirit-forward cocktail preparations.\n3. **Simple Cocktails**: These typically take 30 seconds to 1 minute to prepare, as noted by meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku.\n4. **Classic Cocktails**: The preparation time for classic cocktails like the Old Fashioned and Margarita ranges from 1 to 2 minutes, as suggested by meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku.\n5. **Complex Cocktails**: These can take between 2 to 4 minutes to prepare, considering the time frames mentioned for Mojito and Long Island Iced Tea preparations.\n\n**Omitted Claims and Uncertainties**:\n- The exact definition of \"complex\" vs. \"simple\" cocktails is not universally agreed upon and has been omitted to avoid introducing uncertainty.\n- The impact of different mixing techniques on timing and the distinction between professional and home preparation times are noted as areas requiring further clarification or investigation but are not included due to lack of consensus.\n\n**Retained Claims**:\n- openai/gpt-4o-mini's timing for shaking and stirring cocktails.\n- meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku's categorization of cocktails by complexity and preparation time.\n- The general time ranges for simple, classic, and complex cocktails as agreed upon by the majority of the drafts.\n\n**Confidence Notes**:\n- High confidence in the shaking and stirring times due to specific references.\n- Medium to high confidence in the categorization and timing of simple and classic cocktails, given the consensus among drafts.\n- Lower confidence in the exact timings for complex cocktails due to broader time ranges and less specific references.\n\n**Basic Stats**:\n- Simple Cocktails: 30 seconds - 1 minute\n- Classic Cocktails: 1-2 minutes\n- Complex Cocktails: 2-4 minutes\n- Shaking: 15-20 seconds\n- Stirring: 30-45 seconds\n\nThis synthesis aims to provide a coherent overview of cocktail preparation timing based on the convergent points from the META drafts, while omitting claims that evoke low confidence or are not universally agreed upon.",
