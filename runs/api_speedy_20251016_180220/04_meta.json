    "text": "Upon reviewing the initial drafts of the peers, I noted several points to resolve and clarify:\n\n### Resolved Contradictions:\n1. **Mathematical Accuracy**: Both the peer draft from openai/gpt-4o-mini and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku accurately stated the result of 2 + 2 as 4. This confirmed the correctness of their responses. The Google draft, however, reported an ERROR, which I interpreted as a failure to provide a valid mathematical answer.\n\n### Changes Made:\n1. **Consolidated the Correct Responses**: Emphasized that both openai/gpt-4o-mini and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku correctly calculated 2 + 2 = 4. \n2. **Addressed the Error in Google Draft**: Recognized that the Google draft's error diverged from the successful calculations, indicating a need for clarity or correction on its part.\n\n### Final Consensus Statement:\n- Both OpenAI and Anthropic drafts confirm that 2 + 2 = 4, while Google's output fails to provide a valid answer. \n\nBy summarizing and clarifying the information, it resolves the discrepancy presented in the Google draft and affirms the correctness prevailing in the other two.",

    "text": "META REVIEW PROCESS:\n\n1. Draft Consistency Check:\n- Two out of three drafts converge on \"4\"\n- One draft shows an error/non-standard response\n\n2. Response Verification:\n- Mathematical calculation of 2 + 2 is consistently 4\n- No substantial contradictions detected\n- Minimal variance in responses\n\n3. Potential Improvements:\n- Provide computational proof\n- Explain addition mechanism\n- Cite mathematical principles\n\n4. Revised Response:\n\"2 + 2 = 4 is a fundamental mathematical axiom:\n• Basic integer addition \n• Commutative property applies\n• Verified through multiple computational models\"\n\n5. Contradiction Resolution:\n- Normalized response across draft variations\n- Addressed potential error condition\n- Provided explanatory context\n\n6. Confidence Level: High ✓\n\nMethodological Notes:\n- Used cross-draft verification\n- Maintained mathematical precision\n- Eliminated ambiguity\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this meta-review?",
