  "text": "The question \"What is 2 + 2?\" has been analyzed through multiple sources, yielding the following synthesized response:\n\nThe consensus from the reviews indicates that **2 + 2 equals 4**. Both OpenAI/GPT-4O-Mini and Anthropic/Claude-3.5-Haiku directly affirm this, with the latter simply stating \"4,\" which aligns with the mathematical fact. However, Google/Gemini-2.0-Flash-Exp reported an \"ERROR,\" indicating a processing issue rather than a contradiction to the correct answer.\n\nIn summary, the correct response is that **2 + 2 equals 4**, supported by high confidence in the mathematical validity of this statement (99.9%). Validation from multiple drafts reinforces the accuracy of this computation, while the error noted highlights the importance of ensuring reliable processing in computational responses. \n\nConfidence Level: High \nTotal Drafts Reviewed: 3 \nRetained Claims: 2 (correct responses) \nOmitted Claims: 1 (the error response, as it does not pertain to the correct calculation)",
