    "text": "Based on the peer drafts, I identified a few contradictions regarding the computation of 2 + 2:\n\n1. **OpenAI/GPT-4O-Mini** states that \"2 + 2 equals 4,\" which is a true statement.\n2. **Anthropic/Claude-3.5-Haiku** simply states \"4,\" which also implies that 2 + 2 equals 4.\n3. **Google/Gemini-2.0-Flash-Exp** indicates an \"ERROR,\" which suggests a failure in computation or logic but does not directly contradict the true answer.\n\n### Resolved Contradictions:\n- There is no real contradiction among the accurate computations. The first two drafts correctly convey that 2 + 2 equals 4.\n- The error in the third draft doesn't invalidate the correct statements made by the first two but does highlight a possible failure in reasoning or processing.\n\n### Changes Made:\n- I clarified that the first two drafts agree on the computation result of 2 + 2 while the last draft signifies an error. The focus is on recognizing that despite the error, the overall consensus remains that 2 + 2 equals 4.\n\nIn conclusion, I organized the findings clearly, emphasizing that while there was a processing error noted in one draft, the overall agreement in the other drafts supports the correctness of the computation.",
