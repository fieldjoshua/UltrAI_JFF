  "text": "Based on the provided META drafts, the top 10 quarterbacks of all time can be listed as follows, with a focus on the most commonly mentioned and statistically supported entries:\n\n1. **Tom Brady**: 7x Super Bowl champion, all-time leader in playoff wins and passing yards.\n2. **Joe Montana**: 4x Super Bowl champion, renowned for his clutch performances.\n3. **Peyton Manning**: 2x Super Bowl champion, 5-time NFL MVP known for his pre-snap reads.\n4. **Aaron Rodgers**: 1x Super Bowl champion, 2x NFL MVP, and one of the most efficient quarterbacks in NFL history.\n\n**Retained Claims:**\n- Tom Brady's seven Super Bowl wins (openai/gpt-4o-mini, meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct)\n- Joe Montana's four Super Bowl wins and clutch performances (openai/gpt-4o-mini, meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct)\n- Peyton Manning's 2x Super Bowl wins and 5-time NFL MVP (openai/gpt-4o-mini, meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct)\n- Aaron Rodgers' Super Bowl win and 2x NFL MVP (openai/gpt-4o-mini, meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct)\n\n**Omitted Claims:**\n- Incomplete statistics for Peyton Manning and Aaron Rodgers in some drafts (due to inconsistencies and the decision to rely on the most comprehensive and commonly agreed-upon information)\n- Subjective language and rankings that were not universally supported across the drafts\n\n**Confidence Notes:**\nThe rankings provided are based on the most consistent and widely supported information across the META drafts, focusing on verifiable achievements such as Super Bowl wins, MVP awards, and statistical leadership. However, the subjective nature of ranking the \"top\" quarterbacks means that personal preferences and team loyalties may vary the order or inclusion of certain quarterbacks.\n\n**Basic Stats:**\nThe provided stats include Super Bowl wins, NFL MVP awards, and playoff records, which are key metrics for evaluating quarterback performance and impact on the game.\n\nTo complete the top 10 list as initially proposed, additional research and synthesis of more comprehensive sources would be necessary to ensure that all included quarterbacks have a complete set of achievements and are ranked based on a clear methodology that considers championships, individual stats, and era impact.",
