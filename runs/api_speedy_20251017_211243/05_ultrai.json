  "text": "Based on the analysis of multiple peer model drafts, the consistent answer to the query \"What is 2 + 2?\" is:\n\n**2 + 2 = 4**\n\nHereâ€™s a summary of the contributions from the peer drafts:\n\n1. **OpenAI/gpt-4o-mini**: Provided a clear mathematical statement: \"2 + 2 equals 4,\" which offers clarity in the operation performed.\n2. **Anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku**: Offered a concise numeric answer, \"4,\" which is correct but lacks an explanation of the operation.\n3. **Google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp**: Reported an \"ERROR,\" which is not a valid contribution to the question as it contradicts the established mathematical fact.\n\n**Confidence Notes**:\n- The consensus among the contributing drafts confirms that \"2 + 2 = 4\" is an accurate mathematical equation.\n- The answer is simple arithmetic, which holds a high level of confidence across the reviewed models, with no substantive contradictions on the numeric value itself.\n\nOverall, the coherent synthesis reflects the widely accepted result of adding two and two in basic arithmetic.",
