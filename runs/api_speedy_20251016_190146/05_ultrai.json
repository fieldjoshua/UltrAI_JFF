  "text": "The consensus among the META drafts is that \"2 + 2 equals 4.\" Both openai/gpt-4o-mini and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku provide confirmation of this mathematical statement, while the response from google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp indicates an error in computation but does not contradict the correct outputs of the others.\n\nTo summarize:\n- The accurate calculation is that \"2 + 2\" results in 4, a fact supported by multiple drafts.\n- There were no significant contradictions noted among the models regarding this straightforward arithmetic problem.\n\nFinal Answer: 4\n\nConfidence Notes:\n- High confidence in consensus due to multiple supportive claims across drafts.\n- Verification of basic arithmetic reinforces the reliability of the conclusion. \n\nStatistical Summary:\n- Convergent responses: 2 (confirming \"2 + 2 equals 4\")\n- Response with error: 1 (not processing the equation)",
