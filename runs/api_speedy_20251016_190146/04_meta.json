Both are consistent in that they agree on the result of the addition. The error noted in google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp seems to refer to its inability to process or verify the equation, not contradicting the others but indicating a fault in output.\n\n### Changes Made:\n- I did not contradict the correct outputs of my peers in the initial drafts since they all correctly indicated that \"2 + 2\" sums to 4 or affirmed 4 directly. However, I noted the issue with google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp which would necessitate clarification rather than a mathematical assumption.\n\n### Revised Summary:\nThe consensus among the peer drafts is that \"2 + 2 equals 4\" or simply states \"4\". There are no contradictions in these outputs; however, there’s a noted error with google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp not being able to compute or verify this simple equation.",
