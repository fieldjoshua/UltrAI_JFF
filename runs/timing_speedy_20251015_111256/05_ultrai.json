  "text": "### Synthesized Cocktail Preparation Timing Benchmark\n\nAfter reviewing the META drafts, the following key points have been synthesized to create a comprehensive timing benchmark for cocktail preparation:\n\n**Speed Tiers:**\n- ðŸ¥‰ **Amateur**: 3-5 minutes per cocktail\n- ðŸ¥ˆ **Professional Bartender**: 1-2 minutes per cocktail\n- ðŸ¥‡ **Elite Mixologist**: 45-90 seconds per cocktail\n\nThese speed tiers were retained from the openai/gpt-4o-mini and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku drafts, as they provide a clear categorization of preparation times based on the bartender's experience.\n\n**Preparation Stages:**\n1. **Setup**: This includes gathering ingredients, which can take 15-30 seconds for simple cocktails and up to 1-2 minutes for more complex ones, as reconciled from openai/gpt-4o-mini and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku drafts.\n2. **Mixing Techniques**:\n   - **Shaking**: 10-15 seconds, as consistently agreed upon by all drafts.\n   - **Stirring**: 20-30 seconds, adopted from openai/gpt-4o-mini and meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct drafts.\n\n**Complexity Categories and Preparation Time**:\n- **Simple Cocktails**: <30 seconds to 1 minute\n- **Classic Cocktails**: 45 seconds to 1 minute\n- **Craft Cocktails**: 1-2 minutes\n\nThese categories and times were synthesized from the meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku drafts, providing a flexible framework based on cocktail complexity.\n\n**Notes**:\n- Timing is flexible and depends on individual cocktail requirements and the bartender's experience.\n- Consistent technique is emphasized over strict time limits.\n\n**Claims Retained**:\n- Speed tiers from openai/gpt-4o-mini and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku.\n- Preparation stages with a focus on setup and mixing techniques from all drafts.\n- Complexity categories and their respective times from meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku.\n\n**Claims Omitted**:\n- Specific times for cutting garnishes and chilling glassware due to lack of consensus.\n- The google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp draft was not considered due to an error.\n\n**Basic Stats**:\n- Shaking time: 10-15 seconds\n- Stirring time: 20-30 seconds\n- Amateur preparation time: 3-5 minutes\n- Professional preparation time: 1-2 minutes\n- Elite mixologist preparation time: 45-90 seconds\n\nThis synthesis aims to provide a coherent and comprehensive timing benchmark for cocktail preparation, addressing the user's query while adhering to the critical constraints provided.",
