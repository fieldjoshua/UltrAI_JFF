  "text": "The consensus among the reviewed drafts is that \"2 + 2 equals 4.\" This fundamental mathematical truth is clearly articulated in both OpenAI's and Anthropic's responses. OpenAI states the complete equation while Anthropic offers just the numerical result, which, while correct, lacks the context of the full expression.\n\nGoogleâ€™s response of \"ERROR\" contradicts the clear results provided by OpenAI and Anthropic, indicating a failure in processing rather than a valid computation.\n\nIn summary, the reliable answer to the query is that \"2 + 2 = 4,\" supported by strong consensus, while the \"ERROR\" response from Google highlights an operational failure.\n\n**Confidence Level**: High  \n**Key Points Retained**: \n- OpenAI and Anthropic confirmed \"2 + 2 equals 4.\"\n- Google's \"ERROR\" response noted as a contradiction.  \n- An emphasis on the need for clarity and context was maintained.",
