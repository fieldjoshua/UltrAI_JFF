    "text": "Upon reviewing the drafts, I've identified a few contradictions and made revisions accordingly. Here are the details:\n\n### Contradictions Resolved:\n1. **OpenAI's Draft**: Clearly states that \"2 + 2 equals 4.\" This is a mathematically correct statement.\n   \n2. **Anthropic's Draft**: Simply states \"4\", implying the result of the addition but lacks context. However, this aligns with the mathematical truth presented in OpenAI's draft.\n\n3. **Google's Draft**: Reports \"ERROR\" in response to the question, which contradicts both OpenAI's and Anthropic's responses where the answer is definitively \"4.\" This indicates a failure to compute or process correctly.\n\n### Changes Made:\n- **Integrated Clarity**: I reaffirmed the correctness of the mathematical statement \"2 + 2 equals 4.\" \n- **Addressed Ambiguity**: Clarified that while Anthropic's response is technically correct, it needed more context to be fully understood as it implicitly relies on the knowledge that \"2 + 2\" is being computed.\n- **Highlighted Error**: Emphasized Google's response as an error and acknowledged the contradiction it presents to the clear mathematical resolution provided by OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\n### Revised Summary:\nThe consensus from OpenAI and Anthropic confirms that \"2 + 2 equals 4.\" OpenAI provides the full expression while Anthropic delivers only the numerical result. Google’s response of \"ERROR\" stands in contrast, indicating an operational failure rather than a mathematical result. \n\nOverall, the main takeaway is that the correct answer to the addition of 2 + 2 is consistently recognized as 4, with the dissonance stemming from Google’s inability to produce that outcome.",
