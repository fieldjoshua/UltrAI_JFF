  "text": "The clear and accurate conclusion regarding the arithmetic operation \"2 + 2\" is that it equals \"4.\" This answer is supported by two of the drafts, both of which confirm the arithmetic correctness. One draft, however, indicated an error without providing a valid response, but this does not impact the established conclusion that \"2 + 2 = 4.\" \n\nIn summary, the consolidated and coherent response is: \"2 + 2 equals 4.\" The draft indicating an error is noted but does not alter the correctness of the mathematical statement.",
