Consistency Check\n- Two drafts (openai/gpt-4o-mini and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku) converge on \"4\"\n- One draft (google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp) shows an error state\n\n2. Potential Contradictions/Concerns\n- No substantive mathematical contradiction exists\n- The google/gemini draft requires further investigation\n\n3. RESOLUTION STEPS\n- Validate core mathematical statement: 2 + 2 = 4\n- Note google draft's error prevents direct comparison\n- Recommend technical review of google draft's",

    "text": "In reviewing the PEER DRAFTS, I noted the following contradictions and made the appropriate changes:\n\n1. **Contradiction Between DRAFTS**: \n   - The first draft states \"2 + 2 equals 4,\" which is correct.\n   - The second draft simply states \"4,\" which is a partial response but doesn't address the arithmetic equation.\n   - The third draft mentions \"ERROR\" without providing a valid output, causing confusion about its acknowledgment of the calculation.\n\n2. **Resolved Issues**:\n   - Clarified that the correct response to the equation \"2 + 2\" is indeed \"4\".\n   - Addressed the incomplete response in the second draft by recognizing it aligns with the conclusion in the first draft.\n   - Noted that the third draft's error indicates an issue with processing or communicating the arithmetic question, which requires acknowledgment but does not affect the overall correctness of the equation itself.\n\n**Changes Made**:\n- Consolidated the responses to emphasize that the appropriate and universally accepted answer to \"2 + 2\" is \"4,\" while also recognizing the error mentioned in the third draft as a separate issue unrelated to the arithmetic correctness.\n\n**Final Statement**: The clearest and most accurate conclusion is that \"2 + 2 equals 4\". The other drafts introduce either redundancy or an error, which should be considered when determining the accepted output.",
