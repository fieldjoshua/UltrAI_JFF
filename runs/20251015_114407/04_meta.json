    "text": "In reviewing my peers' drafts, I identified several contradictions and inconsistencies related to the mathematical expression \"2 + 2.\" I addressed these as follows:\n\n1. **Contradiction in Numerical Expression**:\n   - The mathematical equation across all peers consistently leads to the final result of 4. However, there was a lack of uniformity in how the answer was expressed—some drafts wrote \"2 + 2 = 4,\" while others opted for \"2 + 2 equals 4,\" and one draft simply mentioned \"4\" without context.\n\n2. **Clarity and Completeness**:\n   - The draft labeled as \"unknown: ERROR\" presents a clear contradiction as it does not convey the expected calculation result. This draft was addressed by emphasizing the need for coherent communication of mathematical operations.\n\n**Changes Made**:\n- Consolidated the expression of the answer to maintain clarity and ensure all drafts uniformly present \"2 + 2 = 4.\"\n- Eliminated the \"unknown: ERROR\" response by reinforcing the expected mathematical outcome instead of a vague error statement.\n\nHere’s the revised response incorporating the resolved contradictions:\n\n**Revised Draft**: \n2 + 2 = 4. This result is consistent across all examples, affirming the correctness of the statement.",
