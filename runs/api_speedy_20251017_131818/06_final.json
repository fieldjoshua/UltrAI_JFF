  "text": "The responses to the question \"What is 2 + 2?\" indicate a clear consensus on the correct answer. Both the openai/gpt-4o-mini and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku drafts assert that \"2 + 2 equals 4.\" While the first draft provides a clear explanation, the second offers a concise response without additional context. The google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp draft reports an \"ERROR,\" which suggests a failure in processing but does not provide a valid answer.\n\nThus, the synthesis of these responses leads to the final conclusion that 2 + 2 equals 4, confirmed by two drafts, with the acknowledgment that one implementation encountered an error. \n\nFinal Statement: **2 + 2 equals 4, supported by multiple correct responses.**",
