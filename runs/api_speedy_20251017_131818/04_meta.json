However, there are no direct contradictions between the correct responses of the first two drafts and the error indicated by the third.\n\n**Changes Made:**\n- I maintained the correctness of the first two responses while acknowledging that there is an issue with the third draft. \n- I highlighted that both openai/gpt-4o-mini and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku arrive at the same final answer, reinforcing its validity. \n- I noted the importance of error handling, as presented in the google/gemini draft, and indicated that this is an area needing improvement.\n\n**Final Statement:**\nThe initial drafts reveal two correct responses to the equation while highlighting the inadequacy of error management in one implementation.",
