    "text": "In reviewing the initial drafts provided, I noticed the following contradictions and inconsistencies, and I've made the necessary changes to create a cohesive response.\n\n### Contradictions Resolved:\n1. **Numerical Consistency**: Both the OpenAI and Anthropic drafts confirmed that 2 + 2 equals 4. However, the Google draft returned an error. This inconsistency needed to be addressed.\n  \n2. **Quality of Response**: The response from Google indicated an “ERROR” status, which is not acceptable when addressing a mathematical fact. \n\n### Changes Made:\n- I consolidated the reliable information from the OpenAI and Anthropic responses and highlighted that both confirmed the same answer (4).\n- I omitted Google’s response due to its error status, as it did not contribute any valid information. \n\n### Revised Response:\n\"Based on the reviewed drafts, both OpenAI and Anthropic agree that 2 + 2 equals 4. The Google draft, however, encountered an error and does not provide a valid answer.\"\n",
