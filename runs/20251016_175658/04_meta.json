    "text": "# Top 10 Catchers in Baseball History (Revised)\n\nBased on the peer drafts, I've compiled a comprehensive list of the greatest catchers in baseball history, considering their statistical achievements, awards, and overall impact on the game.\n\n## My Top 10 Catchers of All Time\n\n1. **Johnny Bench** (Cincinnati Reds)\n   - 14-time All-Star, 2-time NL MVP (1970, 1972)\n   - 10 Gold Glove Awards\n   - 2 World Series Championships (1975, 1976)\n   - Hall of Fame (1989)\n   - Career: .267/.342/.476, 389 HR\n\n2. **Yogi Berra** (New York Yankees)\n   - 18-time All-Star\n   - 3-time AL MVP (1951, 1954, 1955)\n   - 10 World Series Championships\n   - Hall of Fame (1972)\n   - Career: .285/.348/.482, 358 HR\n\n3. **Josh Gibson** (Negro Leagues)\n   - Considered one of the greatest power hitters in baseball history\n   - Estimated to have hit 800+ home runs in his career\n   - Hall of Fame (1972)\n   - Often called \"the black Babe Ruth\"\n\n4. **Ivan Rodriguez** (Rangers, Tigers, Yankees, others)\n   - 14-time All-Star\n   - 13 Gold Glove Awards (most by a catcher)\n   - 1999 AL MVP\n   - World Series Champion (2003 with Marlins)\n   - Hall of Fame (2017)\n\n5. **Mike Piazza** (Dodgers, Mets, others)\n   - 12-time All-Star\n   - 10-time Silver Slugger\n   - Career .308 batting average with 427 HR\n   - Hall of Fame (2016)\n   - Greatest offensive catcher in MLB history\n\n6. **Roy Campanella** (Brooklyn Dodgers)\n   - 3-time NL MVP (1951, 1953, 1955)\n   - 8-time All-Star\n   - World Series Champion (1955)\n   - Hall of Fame (1969)\n   - Career cut short by car accident that left him paralyzed\n\n7. **Carlton Fisk** (Red Sox, White Sox)\n   - 11-time All-Star\n   - Gold Glove winner\n   - Hall of Fame (2000)\n   - 24-year career (longest for a catcher)\n   - 376 career home runs\n\n8. **Bill Dickey** (New York Yankees)\n   - 11-time All-Star\n   - 8 World Series Championships\n   - Hall of Fame (1954)\n   - .313 career batting average\n\n9. **Mickey Cochrane** (Athletics, Tigers)\n   - 2-time MVP (1928, 1934)\n   - 2-time World Series Champion\n   - Hall of Fame (1947)\n   - .320 career batting average\n\n10. **Gary Carter** (Expos, Mets, others)\n    - 11-time All-Star\n    - 3 Gold Gloves, 5 Silver Sluggers\n    - World Series Champion (1986 Mets)\n    - Hall of Fame (2003)\n\n## Revisions and Resolved Contradictions\n\n1. **Added Yogi Berra** - Multiple peer drafts placed Berra high on their lists, which I had initially overlooked. Given his 10 World Series rings and 3 MVPs, this was a significant omission I needed to correct.\n\n2. **Added Josh Gibson** - One draft highlighted this Negro Leagues superstar whom I hadn't included. His legendary status merits inclusion despite the statistical challenges of comparing Negro League players.\n\n3. **Adjusted rankings** - Based on the consensus from peer drafts, I repositioned some catchers, particularly moving Ivan Rodriguez down slightly from my initial draft.\n\n4. **Expanded statistical information** - Added more comprehensive statistical profiles for each player based on information in the peer drafts.\n\n5. **Added Roy Campanella** - Multiple peers included him high on their lists, and his 3 MVP awards certainly justify his inclusion among the all-time greats.",
