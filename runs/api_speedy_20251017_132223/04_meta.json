Consensus Check:\n- 2/3 drafts suggest \"4\" as the answer\n- 1 draft shows an error\n\n2. Contradiction Analysis:\n- No substantive contradictions exist in the valid responses\n- The error draft does not provide actionable information\n\n3. Verification Method:\n- Basic arithmetic: 2 + 2 = 4 is mathematically correct\n- No contextual complexity requires alternative interpretation\n\nREVISED RESPONSE:\nAnswer: 4\n\nCHANGES & RESOLUTION:\n- Maintained consistent answer\n- Applied careful review protocol\n- Noted error draft as non-informative\n- Confirmed mathematical standard\n\nNOTES:\n- Followed instruction to not assume truth automatically\n- Conducted systematic peer review\n- Validated response through multiple draft comparisons\n\nVerification complete. Response: 4.",
