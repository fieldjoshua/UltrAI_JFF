    "text": "Timing benchmarks for making cocktails can vary based on the complexity of the drink, the experience of the bartender, and the environment (e.g., a busy bar vs. a quiet home setting). However, here are some general guidelines for how long it might take to prepare different types of cocktails:\n\n1. **Simple Cocktails** (2-3 ingredients, built directly in the glass):\n   - **Examples**: Gin & Tonic, Rum & Coke, Screwdriver\n   - **Benchmark**: 30 seconds to 1 minute\n\n2. **Stirred Cocktails** (4-5 ingredients, requires stirring in a mixing glass):\n   - **Examples**: Martini, Manhattan, Negroni\n   - **Benchmark**: 1.5 to 2 minutes\n\n3. **Shaken Cocktails** (require shaking in a cocktail shaker to mix and chill):\n   - **Examples**: Margarita, Whiskey Sour, Mojito\n   - **Benchmark**: 2 to 3 minutes\n\n4. **Blended Cocktails** (require a blender):\n   - **Examples**: Pi√±a Colada, Frozen Daiquiri\n   - **Benchmark**: 3 to 4 minutes\n\n5. **Complex or Elaborate Cocktails** (require multiple steps, garnishes, or infusions):\n   - **Examples**: Craft cocktails with custom syrups or garnishes\n   - **Benchmark**: 4 to 6+ minutes\n\nThese times are rough estimates and will vary based on several factors like ingredient preparation time, proficiency of the person making the drink, and the availability of equipment and ingredients. Professional bartenders can often work faster, especially with practice and in a well-organized bar setting.",
