    "text": "I understand this is a META revision round for reviewing initial draft responses. I'll systematically analyze the peer drafts:\n\nPEER DRAFT ANALYSIS:\n✅ openai/gpt-4o-mini: Claims \"2 + 2 equals 4\" - Direct mathematical statement\n✅ anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku: Responds with \"4\" - Identical result, numeric form\n❌ google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp: Returns \"ERROR\" - Invalid/Failed response\n\nCONTRADICTION RESOLUTION:\n1. Two peers converge on same mathematical result (4)\n2. One peer has an error/invalid response\n3. No substantive contradictions exist in valid responses\n\nREVISION APPROACH:\n- Confirm: 2 + 2 = 4\n- Validate through basic arithmetic principles\n- Highlight peer consensus on mathematical fact\n\nFINAL RESPONSE:\n2 + 2 = 4\n\nCHANGE LOG:\n- Introduced systematic peer review process\n- Analyzed response consistency\n- Validated mathematical statement\n- Maintained original core answer\n\nConfidence Level: High (Mathematical certainty)",
