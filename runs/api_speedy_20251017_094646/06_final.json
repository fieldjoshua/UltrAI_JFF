  "text": "The synthesis of the provided META drafts yields the following response:\n\n**Final Response**: 2 + 2 equals 4.\n\n**Confidence**: High (standard mathematical proof).\n\n**Analysis**: \n1. Multiple drafts consistently convey that the correct answer to the question is that \"2 + 2 equals 4.\" This claim is supported directly by two sources: openai/gpt-4o-mini and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku.\n2. There are no significant contradictions among these responses, aside from the error noted in the google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp draft, which reported an ERROR and did not successfully compute the operation.\n\n**Notes**:\n- The answer “4” is correct but lacks context; therefore, the expression \"2 + 2 equals 4\" provides clarity about the arithmetic process involved.\n- The error from the google/gemini draft suggests issues with processing inputs, emphasizing the importance of reliable calculation in responding to arithmetic queries.",
