    "text": "Based on the peer drafts, here are the contradictions I resolved and the changes I made:\n\n1. **Peer Drafts Review**:\n   - **openai/gpt-4o-mini**: Correctly states that \"2 + 2 equals 4.\"\n   - **anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku**: Simply states \"4,\" which is a correct answer but lacks the context of addition.\n   - **google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free**: Reports an \"ERROR,\" which suggests it did not compute the operation correctly.\n\n2. **Contradictions Resolved**:\n   - The contradiction between the clarity of \"2 + 2 equals 4\" and simply stating \"4\" was recognized. Though both statements convey the same truth, one provides necessary contextâ€”hence, clarity was enhanced.\n   - The \"ERROR\" output from google/gemini indicates a failure to process the operation properly, which contradicts the other two outputs. This suggests the necessity for reliable computation, so it's clear that accuracy is critical in these kinds of tasks.\n\n3. **What Changed**:\n   - I decided to maintain the mathematical clarity seen in \"2 + 2 equals 4\" from openai/gpt-4o-mini while acknowledging the succinctness of the answer given in the anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku draft. \n   - To enhance understanding, I could combine elements by stating that \"2 + 2 equals 4 is a clear and accurate mathematical expression while alternatives like simply stating '4' work but may lack context.\"\n   - Lastly, highlighted the error in the google/gemini draft as a cautionary note for the importance of verifying computations.\n\n**Final Summary**: The answer to \"What is 2 + 2?\" is clearly \"2 + 2 equals 4,\" emphasizing the importance of accuracy and context in mathematical communication while recognizing errors in computation as critical obstacles to understanding.",
