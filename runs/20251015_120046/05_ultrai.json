  "text": "# Top 10 Starting Pitchers of All Time: A Sabermetric Analysis\n\nBased on the convergence of multiple sabermetric analyses, here are the greatest starting pitchers in MLB history:\n\n## Methodology\nThis ranking considers these key advanced metrics:\n- WAR (Wins Above Replacement) from Baseball-Reference (bWAR)\n- ERA+ (ERA adjusted for ballpark and era)\n- FIP (Fielding Independent Pitching)\n- WHIP (Walks plus Hits per Inning Pitched)\n- K/BB ratio (Strikeout-to-walk ratio)\n- Peak performance dominance\n- Career longevity and consistency\n\n## The Top 10\n\n1. **Walter Johnson (1907-1927)**\n   * Career bWAR: 152.3\n   * ERA+: 147\n   * Dominated the Dead Ball Era with unparalleled effectiveness\n\n2. **Cy Young (1890-1911)**\n   * Career bWAR: 168.4\n   * 511 career wins\n   * 7,356 innings pitched\n   * Extraordinary longevity across changing eras\n\n3. **Roger Clemens (1984-2007)**\n   * Career bWAR: 139.2\n   * 7 Cy Young Awards\n   * 4,672 strikeouts\n   * Dominant across multiple decades\n\n4. **Greg Maddux (1986-2008)**\n   * Career bWAR: 114.8\n   * ERA+: 132\n   * 4 consecutive Cy Young Awards (1992-1995)\n   * Exceptional command and control\n\n5. **Randy Johnson (1988-2009)**\n   * Career bWAR: 110.6\n   * 4,875 strikeouts\n   * 5 Cy Young Awards\n   * Dominant power pitcher, especially in his 30s\n\n6. **Pedro Martinez (1992-2009)**\n   * Career bWAR: 91.1\n   * Highest ERA+ for starters: 154\n   * Historically dominant peak (1997-2003)\n\n7. **Tom Seaver (1967-1986)**\n   * Career bWAR: 106.1\n   * ERA+: 127\n   * Exceptional consistency across two decades\n\n8. **Lefty Grove (1925-1941)**\n   * Career bWAR: 109.9\n   * ERA+: 148\n   * Nine ERA titles\n\n9. **Christy Mathewson (1900-1916)**\n   * Career bWAR: 106.5\n   * 2.13 career ERA\n   * Early pioneer of the screwball\n\n10. **Sandy Koufax (1955-1966)**\n    * Peak dominance (1962-1966) unmatched\n    * ERA+: 131\n    * Short but historically dominant career\n\n**Synthesis Notes:**\n- High confidence in the top 3 pitchers, as all META drafts consistently ranked Johnson, Young, and Clemens at or near the top\n- Statistics like bWAR, ERA+, and career achievements showed strong convergence across models\n- I omitted contradictory or uncertain data where models showed significant disagreement on specific metrics\n- The Claude-3.7 draft provided the most comprehensive statistical breakdown, which formed the foundation of this synthesis",
