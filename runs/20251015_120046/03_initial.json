    "text": "Ranking the top 10 starting pitchers of all time using sabermetric analysis involves examining advanced metrics such as:\n\n- WAR (Wins Above Replacement) – particularly from FanGraphs (fWAR) and Baseball-Reference (bWAR)\n- ERA+ (adjusted ERA, accounting for league and ballpark)\n- FIP (Fielding Independent Pitching)\n- WHIP (Walks + Hits per Inning Pitched)\n- K/BB (Strikeout-to-walk ratio)\n- Peak dominance (best 5-7 years)\n- Longevity and consistency\n\nHere’s a sabermetrically informed ranking of the top 10 starting pitchers in MLB history, incorporating career value and peak performance:\n\n---\n\n**1. Walter Johnson**  \n- WAR (bWAR): 164.5 | fWAR: 145.6  \n- ERA+: 147  \n- FIP: 2.39  \n- Considered the ultimate dead-ball era ace, Johnson leads in bWAR for pitchers. His overpowering fastball dominated early 20th-century baseball.\n\n---\n\n**2. Roger Clemens**  \n- WAR (bWAR): 138.7 | fWAR: 133.7  \n- ERA+: 143  \n- FIP: 3.09  \n- A powerful workhorse with seven Cy Young Awards. Despite PED controversies, Clemens’ sabermetric record is nearly unmatched.\n\n---\n\n**3. Pedro Martínez**  \n- WAR (bWAR): 83.9 | fWAR: 86.1  \n- ERA+: 154 (2nd highest ever for a SP)  \n- FIP: 2.91  \n- Pedro's peak (1997–2003) is arguably the most dominant in MLB history. In the offense-crazed steroid era, his performance was off the charts.\n\n---\n\n**4. Greg Maddux**  \n- WAR (bWAR): 106.6 | fWAR: 120.3  \n- ERA+: 132  \n- FIP: 3.26  \n- Maddux combined pinpoint control with masterful pitching IQ. His 1992–1998 peak was one of the best prolonged runs ever.\n\n---\n\n**5. Tom Seaver**  \n- WAR (bWAR): 106.9 | fWAR: 96.3  \n- ERA+: 127  \n- FIP: 3.04  \n- Known as “The Franchise,” Seaver was elite in both longevity and peak performance, leading the NL in adjusted ERA+ several times.\n\n---\n\n**6. Randy Johnson**  \n- WAR (bWAR): 101.1 | fWAR: 111.7  \n- ERA+: 135  \n- FIP: 3.19  \n- A towering strikeout machine – 4,875 career Ks. His peak (1999–2002): 1.01 WHIP, 1,417 K in 1,030 IP.\n\n---\n\n**7. Lefty Grove**  \n- WAR (bWAR): 113.3 | fWAR: 96.8  \n- ERA+: 148  \n- FIP: 2.87  \n- One of the most dominant lefties ever, Grove led the AL in ERA+ nine times and had a career ERA+ nearly unmatched.\n\n---\n\n**8. Clayton Kershaw**  \n- WAR (bWAR): 79.7 (as of 2023) | fWAR: 74.5  \n- ERA+: 156  \n- FIP: 2.60  \n- The best regular-season pitcher of his era. Kershaw's ERA+ is among the top ever, and his FIP suggests elite independent performance.\n\n---\n\n**9. Christy Mathewson**  \n- WAR (bWAR): 106.5 | fWAR: 120.4  \n- ERA+: 135  \n- FIP not available for full career  \n- Pre-modern dominance.

Bert Blyleven**  \n- WAR (bWAR): 94.5 | fWAR: 91.3  \n- ERA+: 118  \n- FIP: 3.19  \n- Blyleven’s advanced stats exceeded his traditional numbers. 3,701 Ks and top-10 FIP marks highlight underrated greatness.\n\n---\n\n**Honorable Mentions (based on sabermetrics):**  \n- Bob Gibson (128 ERA+, 81.9 bWAR)  \n- Zack Greinke (144 ERA+, 76.7 fWAR & ongoing)  \n- Steve Carlton (90.2 bWAR, 115 ERA+)  \n- Sandy Koufax (131 ERA+, short but dominant peak)  \n- Max Scherzer (70+ WAR, elite ERA+ and K/BB)\n\n---\n\n**Note**: Rankings may vary depending on peak vs. career value. This list aims to balance both using modern analytics and context adjusters (ERA+, FIP, WAR).",
