    "text": "After reviewing the initial drafts provided by peers, here are the contradictions I resolved and the changes made:\n\n1. **Contradiction**: The first draft states that \"2 + 2 equals 4,\" which is mathematically accurate. The second draft simply states \"4\" without context, which is somewhat ambiguous but not contradictory. The third draft disrupts coherence by stating \"ERROR,\" implying a failure in computation or understanding.\n\n   **Change Made**: I clarified that \"2 + 2 equals 4\" is indeed a correct statement and interpreted the ambiguity of \"4\" as referring to the same number but without the equation context. I acknowledged the third draft's \"ERROR\" as indicating a malfunction rather than a mathematical statement, which could confuse the overall understanding.\n\n**Final Revised Answer**: \n\"Based on the initial drafts, '2 + 2 equals 4' is accurate, confirming the sum as '4.' The draft claiming 'ERROR' suggests a computation failure. Therefore, all drafts signify that the correct answer is 4, but with varying degrees of clarity and correctness.\"",

    "text": "Let me break down my META revision review process:\n\nDRAFT COMPARISON:\nâœ… Numerical Consistency: \n- 2 models (OpenAI, Claude) agree on \"4\"\n- 1 model (Gemini) returned an error\n\nVALIDATION STEPS:\n1. Basic arithmetic confirms 2 + 2 = 4\n2. No significant contradictions detected\n\nREVISED RESPONSE:\n2 + 2 = 4\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n- No substantive changes required\n- Maintained original computational verification\n\nCONTRADICTIONS RESOLVED:\n- Gemini's error does not invalidate the mathematical fact\n- Cross-model consensus supports the answer\n\nCONFIDENCE LEVEL: High (mathematical proof)\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this meta-review process?",
