  "text": "Based on the collected responses from multiple models, it is clear that the consensus is that **2 + 2 equals 4**. This affirmation is supported by two of the models explicitly stating the correct answer as \"4.\" One draft, however, presented an \"ERROR,\" indicating a computation failure, which does not dispute the mathematical accuracy of the equation itself.\n\nTo summarize, while the majority agree on the mathematical validity of the statement, the presence of an error reported in one draft does not detract from the conclusion. Ultimately, the correct answer to the user's query is:\n\n**2 + 2 = 4** \n\nThis synthesis reflects a high confidence level regarding the mathematical correctness, with all drafts, except one, aligning on this fundamental arithmetic fact.",
