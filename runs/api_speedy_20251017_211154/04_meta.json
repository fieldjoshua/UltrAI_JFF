    "text": "In reviewing the peer drafts, I identified some contradictions and inconsistencies in the initial responses concerning the equation \"2 + 2.\" Here’s a summary of what I resolved and changed:\n\n1. **Contradictions Identified**:\n   - The first draft states that \"2 + 2 equals 4,\" which correctly represents basic arithmetic.\n   - The second draft simply states \"4,\" which implies the answer without demonstrating the calculation.\n   - The third draft has an \"ERROR\" response, indicating there was some issue with the computation or output.\n\n2. **Changes Made**:\n   - I clarified that the arithmetic operation \"2 + 2\" is correctly solved, reaffirming that it equals 4, as presented in the first draft.\n   - I decided to address the ambiguity in the second draft. Although it is ultimately correct, it's less informative than the first draft because it does not show the operation.\n   - I omitted the third draft entirely since it contains an error rather than a valid mathematical output.\n\n**Revised Summary**:\n- The first and second drafts ultimately agreed on the final answer of \"4,\" but the first draft is more informative. The third draft's \"ERROR\" shows a failure in processing that information. Thus, the optimal answer remains the first draft's comprehensive approach, which offers clarity and correctness. \n\nFinal note: \"2 + 2 equals 4.\"",
