The first draft highlights the equation distinctly, ensuring clarity in the explanation, while the second draft gives a concise affirmation of the result without additional context. The erroneous response from the third draft was omitted due to its failure to provide a correct mathematical output.\n\n**Confidence Notes:**\n- Both reliable drafts consistently affirm the result \"4,\" leading to high confidence in this conclusion.\n- No critical contradictions were found in the consensus, reinforcing the validity of the answer.\n\nIn summary, the answer to your question is: \"2 + 2 equals 4.\"",
