  "text": "The calculation of \"2 + 2\" universally results in \"4.\" This result is confirmed by multiple sources, specifically OpenAI GPT-4o Mini and Anthropic Claude 3.5, both of which accurately state that \"2 + 2 = 4.\" However, Google Gemini 2.0 indicated an \"ERROR,\" which suggests a failure to correctly compute the equation and contradicts the established mathematical fact.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer to \"2 + 2\" is definitively \"4,\" as supported by reliable outputs from two models, while an error from a third model highlights the importance of ensuring accurate computation in simple arithmetic operations. \n\nConfidence notes: The synthesis draws upon consistent conclusions from GPT-4o Mini and Claude 3.5, while addressing the error noted in Google Gemini 2.0, ensuring a coherent and accurate response without introducing new information.",
