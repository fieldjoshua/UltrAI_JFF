    "text": "In reviewing the peer drafts regarding the expression of the mathematical equation \"2 + 2\", I identified some contradictions and made corresponding changes to better align the responses. \n\n### Contradictions Resolved:\n1. **OpenAI GPT-4o Mini:** The response correctly states that \"2 + 2 equals 4.\" This is a universally accepted mathematical fact.\n   \n2. **Anthropic Claude 3.5 Haiku:** This response provides just the number \"4,\" which is an accurate and simplified expression of the result of the equation but lacks context.\n\n3. **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp:** The response indicates \"ERROR,\" which may suggest a failure to compute or process the equation correctly. This contradicts the other two responses that correctly provide the result.\n\n### Changes Made:\n- **Clarification of Responses:** I maintain the correctness of GPT-4o Mini's and Claude 3.5's outputs, as both indicate that \"2 + 2 = 4.\" However, Claude 3.5's lack of context could be improved by clarifying that it represents the calculated result instead of just providing the number.\n\n- **Addressing Error:** I noted that the \"ERROR\" from Google Gemini indicates a fundamental misunderstanding or failure in computing the addition that contradicts the established mathematical truth. This was flagged as potentially misleading.\n\n### Revised General Summary:\nThe correct computation of \"2 + 2\" universally results in \"4.\" According to OpenAI GPT-4o Mini and Anthropic Claude 3.5, there are valid outputs of this calculation, while Google Gemini 2.0 indicates an error, which needs clarification or correction to align with standard mathematical knowledge.",
