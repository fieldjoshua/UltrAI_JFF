The two consistent responses agree on the result of the equation 2 + 2.\n\n Contradictions resolved:\n- Ignored error responses from unknown sources\n- Confirmed the correct result of the equation through consistent responses from meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct and openai/gpt-3.5-turbo\n\nWhat changed:\n- My response now reflects the consistent result from the peer drafts, which is 2 + 2 = 4.\n- I have ignored the error responses and focused on the consistent and useful information provided by the other peers. \n\nMy revised answer is: 2 + 2 = 4.",
