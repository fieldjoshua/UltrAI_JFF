    "text": "I'll review these initial draft responses and analyze them for consistency and accuracy.\n\nREVIEW PROCESS:\n1. Mathematical Statement Evaluation\n2. Consensus Check\n3. Contradiction Analysis\n\nDRAFT ANALYSIS:\n- openai/gpt-4o-mini: Provides a complete mathematical expression (\"2 + 2 equals 4\")\n- anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku: Provides only the result (\"4\")\n- google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp: Returned an error\n\nRESOLVED CONTRADICTIONS:\n- Different response formats (full statement vs numeric result)\n- One draft contains an error\n\nVERIFICATION STEPS:\n1. Confirm mathematical accuracy\n2. Standardize response format\n3. Ensure clear communication\n\nRECOMMENDED RESPONSE:\n\"2 + 2 = 4\"\n\nRATIONALE:\n- Mathematically correct\n- Concise\n- Uses standard algebraic notation\n- Addresses variations in initial drafts\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n- Standardized response format\n- Removed verbose explanations\n- Ensured mathematical precision\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this meta-review?",

    "text": "Upon reviewing the peer drafts, I noticed the following contradictions and resolved them:\n\n1. **Contradiction between numerical answers**: \n   - The OpenAI draft states \"2 + 2 equals 4,\" while the Anthropic draft simply states \"4.\" The second draft does not provide context or a mathematical statement, which could lead to ambiguity about what \"4\" refers to.\n   - The Google draft indicates an \"ERROR,\" which implies that there was a failure in processing, and no valid answer was returned.\n\n**Resolved Changes**:\n- **Clarity**: I will clarify that 2 + 2 will always equal 4 regardless of how itâ€™s stated. However, the second draft also conveys the correct answer, albeit without context.\n- **Consistency of Answer**: I confirmed that both OpenAI and Anthropic drafts derive the correct answer to the equation; thus, the focus should be on providing context where needed, especially in the Anthropic draft.\n\n### Revised Statement\n- The sum of 2 and 2 is consistently recognized as 4, as established in the initial drafts.\n\nFinal note: The Google draft did not convey a valid mathematical answer; thus, recognizing errors is essential for maintaining accuracy in responses.",
