  "text": "The synthesis of the META drafts leads to the following coherent response:\n\n\"2 + 2 = 4\"\n\nThis response is produced with confidence as it reflects the consistent mathematical agreement across the reviewed drafts. The OpenAI draft clearly states the equation and its result, while the Anthropic draft provides the correct numerical result. The Google draft did not return a valid answer and was noted as an error, which we have omitted in this synthesis.\n\nKey points retained in this synthesis:\n- The correct mathematical expression and result from OpenAI and Anthropic drafts.\n- Clarity and conciseness were prioritized to ensure the answer is direct and informative.\n\nOverall, the synthesis removes any ambiguity and presents a unified response based on the reliable drafts.
