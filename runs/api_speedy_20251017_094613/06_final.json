  "text": "Synthesis of META Drafts:\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided drafts, the consensus on the user's query \"What is 2 + 2?\" is that the answer is unequivocally \"2 + 2 equals 4.\" This conclusion is supported by multiple drafts that confirm this arithmetic truth. \n\nKey points incorporated:\n1. The claim \"2 + 2 equals 4\" was retained from the first draft as a direct, clear statement of the arithmetic operation (from openai/gpt-4o-mini).\n2. The numeric response \"4\" from the second draft (anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku) was acknowledged as concise but was rephrased to maintain clarity by stating \"2 + 2 equals 4.\"\n3. The mention of an \"ERROR\" from the third draft (google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp) was omitted since it did not provide relevant information regarding the arithmetic operation and instead indicated a potential system issue.\n\nOverall, the conclusion is presented with high confidence based on consistent responses from functional drafts. Therefore, the final answer remains:\n\n\"2 + 2 equals 4.\"\n\nConfidence notes: High confidence; minimal variability in responses from functional systems. Omitted any references to errors as irrelevant to the mathematical claim.",
