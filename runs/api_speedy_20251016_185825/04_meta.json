The first two drafts state that 2 + 2 equals 4, which is consistent. The error from the third draft introduces a discrepancy by not providing a valid answer and instead displaying an error.\n2. The peer drafts did not account for the context in which the error occurred, leading to confusion regarding the expected outputs.\n\n**What Changed:**\n- I clarified that while both openai's and anthropic's drafts correctly confirm that 2 + 2 equals 4, gemini's report of an \"ERROR\" suggests a breakdown in processing or a failure to compute the basic arithmetic, which is not acceptable in this context.\n- I emphasized the need for accurate outputs and consistency in responses, highlighting that basic arithmetic should not lead to errors.\n\nBased on this, the final response can be consolidated into a statement like: \"When asked about the computation of 2 + 2, both OpenAI and Anthropic correctly state that 2 + 2 equals 4. However, Google's response indicates an error in computation, which is inconsistent with the mathematical truth.\"",
