  "text": "When asked about the computation of 2 + 2, both OpenAI and Anthropic correctly state that 2 + 2 equals 4. This is a fundamental arithmetic truth, validated by multiple sources. However, Google's response indicated an \"ERROR\" in computation, which does not align with the expected result. Therefore, the agreed mathematical response is that 2 + 2 equals 4, highlighting a discrepancy in Google's output.\n\nConfidence Level: High  \nContradictions Resolved: Not applicable, as the consensus was clear regarding the correct answer.",
