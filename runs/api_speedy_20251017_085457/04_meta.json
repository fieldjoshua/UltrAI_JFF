    "text": "In reviewing the peer drafts, I identified several contradictions and inconsistencies among the responses regarding the mathematical expression \"2 + 2 equals 4.\"\n\n1. **Contradictions Resolved**:\n   - The first draft states, \"2 + 2 equals 4,\" which is accurate and straightforward.\n   - The second draft simply states \"4,\" which implies the same truth but lacks clarity; it does not explicitly mention the operation.\n   - The third draft indicates \"ERROR,\" which could imply a failure to compute or interpret the expression effectively.\n\n2. **Changes Made**:\n   - I clarified that \"2 + 2 = 4\" is a mathematically true statement and consistent across the first two drafts.\n   - I addressed the \"ERROR\" assertion from the third draft, potentially clarifying that any output indicating an error is incorrect, given that the sum is correctly computable.\n\nThus, my revised response should affirm the operational truth (2 + 2 = 4) and dismiss the notion of error from the third draft, ensuring all perspectives align with the established mathematical fact. \n\n**Revised Response**:\nThe operation \"2 + 2\" consistently leads to the result of \"4.\" While one draft clearly states the equation, another implies it without clarity, and the third incorrectly signals an error in computation. All drafts should confirm that 2 + 2 equals 4 without ambiguity.",
