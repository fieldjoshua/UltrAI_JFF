  "text": "The mathematical operation \"2 + 2\" consistently yields the result \"4.\" This is affirmed by two of the drafts which state the equation explicitly and the result clearly. The first draft provides a full arithmetic explanation stating, \"2 + 2 equals 4,\" while the second draft succinctly confirms the result with \"4.\" \n\nHowever, the third draft encountered an ERROR, suggesting a computational issue rather than a failure in the mathematical principle itself. Thus, it is important to dismiss the notion of error in relation to this straightforward arithmetic operation.\n\nIn summary, the coherent answer to the user's query is: **2 + 2 = 4.** \n\n**Confidence Level: High (99.9%)**. This confidence is based on the consistency found in the first two drafts, while the third draft's ERROR is not relevant to the accuracy of the mathematical statement.",
