The erroneous claim of \"ERROR\" from google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp was omitted as it does not reflect a valid output. The consensus across the drafts emphasizes the correctness of the statement, and there were no substantive contradictions in the mathematical content. \n\n**Confidence Note**: High confidence in the accuracy of the answer based on consistent agreement among the reviewed drafts.",
