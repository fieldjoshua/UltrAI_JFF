  "text": "The answer to the question \"What is 2 + 2?\" is: **2 + 2 equals 4**.\n\nThis synthesis retains the mathematical clarity from the drafts that accurately confirm the result (openai/gpt-4o-mini and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku). The erroneous claim of \"ERROR\" from google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp was omitted as it does not reflect a valid output. The consensus across the drafts emphasizes the correctness of the statement, and there were no substantive contradictions in the mathematical content. \n\n**Confidence Note**: High confidence in the accuracy of the answer based on consistent agreement among the reviewed drafts.",
