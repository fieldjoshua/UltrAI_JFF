    "text": "I will carefully review these drafts with a critical perspective:\n\nANALYSIS:\n1. Drafts are mostly consistent about the result being \"4\"\n2. One draft (google/gemini) has an error, which requires investigation\n\nPOTENTIAL RESOLUTION:\n- The basic mathematical claim of \"2 + 2 = 4\" appears stable across functional models\n- The error from the Google draft suggests a system-level issue rather than a mathematical disagreement\n\nCONTRADICTIONS ADDRESSED:\n- No substantive mathematical contradiction exists\n- The Google error appears non-substantive and likely a system/formatting problem\n\nREVISED RESPONSE:\n2 + 2 = 4\n\nMETHODOLOGY NOTES:\n- Maintained conservative approach\n- Verified against multiple sources\n- Acknowledged potential variance in draft presentation\n- Prioritized mathematical consistency\n\nThe response remains fundamentally unchanged due to mathematical clarity and peer draft alignment.",
