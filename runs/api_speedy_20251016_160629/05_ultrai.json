  "text": "The consensus from the analyzed META drafts indicates that the correct answer to the question \"What is 2 + 2?\" is 4. Both the drafts from meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku confirm this calculation. In contrast, the google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free draft encountered an error and did not provide a valid mathematical statement. Consequently, the error response was disregarded in favor of the accurate and consistent answers found in the other two drafts.\n\nFinal synthesis: **2 + 2 = 4**.\n\nConfidence notes:\n- Retained the agreement from two drafts that supported the answer.\n- Omitted the erroneous response from the third draft due to its lack of validity. \n\nBasic stats:\n- Total drafts analyzed: 3\n- Drafts supporting the correct answer: 2\n- Drafts with error: 1",
