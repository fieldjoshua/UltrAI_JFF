The consensus among the other two drafts confirms that the correct answer is indeed 4.\n\nChanges:\n- Initially, there was no answer.\n- After reviewing peer drafts, the answer is confirmed to be 4, based on the agreement between meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku.\n- The error response from google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free was disregarded due to its invalidity.\n\nContradictions resolved:\n- The disagreement between the valid responses and the error response was resolved by disregarding the error and accepting the consensus among the valid responses. \n\nAnswer: 2 + 2 = 4.",

    "text": "I'll help review these drafts systematically:\n\nDRAFT ANALYSIS:\n1. meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct: \n- Calculation stated: 2 + 2 = 4\n- Seems mathematically consistent\n\n2. anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku:\n- Calculation stated: 4, explicitly noting \"2+2 equals 4\"\n- Matches previous draft, consistent\n\n3. google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free:\n- Returned an ERROR\n- Cannot validate mathematical claim\n\nCONTRADICTIONS RESOLVED:\n- No direct contradictions found\n- All valid responses converge on \"2+2=4\"\n- ERROR response requires further investigation\n\nCHANGES MADE:\n- Maintained mathematical standard\n- Noted potential system issue with Gemini draft\n- Preserved computational consistency\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\n- Proceed with standard mathematical validation\n- 2 + 2 = 4 remains the correct mathematical statement\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this review?",
