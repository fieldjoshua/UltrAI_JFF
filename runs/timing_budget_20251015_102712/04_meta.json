One draft states that it typically takes about 2-3 minutes, while another draft provides more detailed timing benchmarks for various types of cocktails, ranging from 10-15 seconds for simple cocktails to 1-2 minutes for complex cocktails.\n\nTherefore, to address this contradiction, I will provide a revised response that reflects the range of preparation times based on the complexity of the drink, as outlined in the detailed timing benchmarks. Additionally, I will stress the importance of being patient and respectful towards bartenders during busy times.",

    "text": "Upon reviewing the peer drafts, I noticed contradictions in the estimated time it takes to prepare a cocktail. The openai/gpt-3.5-turbo draft suggests that it typically takes about 2-3 minutes to make a standard cocktail, while the meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct draft provides more specific timing benchmarks for different types of cocktails, with some simple cocktails taking as little as 10-15 seconds to prepare.\n\nTo resolve these contradictions, I will provide a revised answer that takes into account the varying complexity of cocktails and the corresponding preparation times. According to the meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct draft, simple cocktails with 2-3 ingredients can be prepared in 10-15 seconds, while classic cocktails with 4-5 ingredients take around 30-60 seconds, and complex cocktails with 6-8 ingredients can take 1-2 minutes.\n\nThe main changes to my answer are:\n\n1. **More specific timing benchmarks**: Instead of providing a general estimate of 2-3 minutes, I will use the more specific timing benchmarks from the meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct draft.\n2. **Accounting for cocktail complexity**: I will consider the varying complexity of cocktails and provide preparation times accordingly.\n3. **Excluding erroneous drafts**: I will disregard the google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free and qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct drafts due to errors.\n\nRevised answer:\nThe time it takes to prepare a cocktail can vary greatly depending on the complexity of the drink. Simple cocktails with 2-3 ingredients, such as a Gin & Tonic or Vodka Soda, can be prepared in as little as 10-15 seconds. Classic cocktails with 4-5 ingredients, like an Old Fashioned or Margarita, typically take around 30-60 seconds. More complex cocktails with 6-8 ingredients, such as a Pimm's Cup or Mai Tai, can take 1-2 minutes to prepare. It's essential to be patient and respectful of bartenders, especially during busy times, as they work to serve all customers in a timely manner.",
