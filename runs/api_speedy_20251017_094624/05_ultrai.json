  "text": "The synthesis of the responses regarding the query \"What is 2 + 2?\" is as follows:\n\n**Final Answer:**\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n### Synthesis Explanation:\nAll reviewed drafts confirm that the mathematical statement \"2 + 2 equals 4\" is accurate. Specifically:\n\n1. **OpenAI's Draft**: Clearly states \"2 + 2 equals 4.\"\n2. **Anthropic's Draft**: Also concludes \"2 + 2 equals 4,\" but includes an extraneous leading \"4.\" which has been removed for clarity.\n3. **Google's Draft**: Produced an \"ERROR\" response, which does not contribute to the mathematical assertion.\n\n### Changes Made:\n- The statement was standardized using the mathematical notation \"=\" rather than the word \"equals.\"\n- Extraneous prefixes and the error response were omitted to ensure a clear and focused answer.\n\n### Confidence Notes:\n- There is complete agreement among the valid responses regarding the accuracy of the statement.\n- The revision enhances clarity while maintaining mathematical correctness based on the coherent consensus from the drafts. \n\nOverall, the final answer affirms the straightforward mathematical fact that 2 + 2 equals 4, with clarity and precision.",
