Removed the \"ERROR\" from the final consensus, affirming that standard arithmetic confirms the result.\n\n**Changes:**\n- The final consensus now reads simply \"2 + 2 equals 4,\" disregarding the conflicting \"ERROR\" input and confirming consistency in stating the arithmetic truth. \n\nIn summary, I resolved the discrepancy by reinforcing the correct numerical outcome while disregarding the erroneous assertion from the third draft.",
