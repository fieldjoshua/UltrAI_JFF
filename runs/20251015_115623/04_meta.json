All three peers (openai/gpt-4o, anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet, and meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct) agree that 2 + 2 equals 4.\n\nContradictions resolved: None. All peer drafts provided the same answer, which is consistent with basic arithmetic principles.\n\nChanges: None. Given the unanimous agreement among my peers and the fundamental nature of the equation, my response aligns with theirs: 2 + 2 indeed equals 4.",

There are no contradictions between these responses.\n\nSince I'm being asked to review initial drafts but I haven't submitted one myself, I'll simply confirm that the mathematical equation 2 + 2 = 4 is correct.",
