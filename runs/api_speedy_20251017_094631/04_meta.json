However, google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp provides an \"ERROR,\" which suggests there might have been a miscalculation or failure to compute in that particular response.\n\n2. **Changes Made**: \n   - I maintained the validated responses from both openai and anthropic drafts while noting the discrepancy with google's output. I adjusted the final response to reflect the consensus of the two consistent answers (4) while highlighting the error from the Google draft for completeness.\n\n**Final Revision**: \n\"Based on the consistent answers from openai/gpt-4o-mini and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku, it can be concluded that 2 + 2 equals 4. However, google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp reported an ERROR, indicating a potential miscalculation.\"",

    "text": "I understand the META revision instruction. I'll analyze the peer drafts systematically:\n\nDRAFT COMPARISON:\n✅ Consistent Agreement:\n- 2 drafts converge on \"4\" (openai and anthropic)\n- Mathematical calculation seems stable\n\n❗ Issues/Observations:\n- google/gemini draft shows an ERROR\n- No substantive contradiction detected\n\nREVISION STEPS:\n1. Verify mathematical basic calculation\n2. Confirm simple arithmetic\n3. Maintain consistency with verified peers\n\nFINAL RESPONSE:\n2 + 2 = 4 ✓\n\nCONTRADICTIONS RESOLVED:\n- No major contradictions found\n- ERROR from google draft not substantively impacting result\n\nCONFIDENCE LEVEL: High (mathematical certainty)\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this analysis?",
