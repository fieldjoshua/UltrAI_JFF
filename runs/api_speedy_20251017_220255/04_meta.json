The mention of an error in the third draft needs to be addressed as a separate incident, indicating that it failed to compute or interpret the arithmetic correctly.\n\nIn summary, the revision solidifies the accuracy of the arithmetic (2 + 2 = 4) presented in the first two drafts while recognizing that the third drew attention to an error that is not indicative of the mathematical truth.",
