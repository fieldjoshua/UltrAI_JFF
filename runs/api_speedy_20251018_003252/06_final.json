  "text": "Upon synthesizing the META drafts regarding the query \"What is 2 + 2?\", the following coherent answer can be provided:\n\n**2 + 2 equals 4.**\n\nThis conclusion is supported by the drafts from both openai and anthropic, which affirm the equation holds true. The draft from google indicated an \"ERROR,\" suggesting a computational issue, but it does not detract from the accurate answer provided by the other models.\n\n### Confidence Notes:\n- Both openai/gpt-4o-mini and anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku reached the same conclusion without contradiction.\n- The conflicting response from google was disregarded as it does not provide a valid answer.\n\n### Basic Stats:\n- Total drafts reviewed: 3\n- Drafts affirming correct answer: 2\n- Drafts indicating error: 1\n\nIn summary, 2 + 2 correctly equals 4, aligning with established mathematical principles.",
