    "text": "Upon reviewing the peer drafts, I noticed the following contradictions and made the necessary changes:\n\n1. **Contradiction in Numerical Answers**: \n   - The draft from openai states \"2 + 2 equals 4,\" which is accurate. \n   - The draft from anthropic simply states \"4,\" which is correct but lacks explanation.\n   - The draft from google indicates an \"ERROR,\" suggesting an issue with its computation or logic.\n\n**Resolution**:\n- I will clarify that 2 + 2 indeed equals 4 based on quantitative understanding and is confirmed by the openai draft. The anthropic draft, while accurate, does not provide context or a complete equation. The google draft indicates an error that may need further investigation.\n\n**What Changed**:\n- I reconciled the different approaches by affirming the correct answer (4) and emphasizing the consensus from the openai draft while dismissing the \"ERROR\" from google's draft as a computational failure. There was no need to adopt the incomplete nature of the response from anthropic without adding clarity.\n\nFinal Summary: In reviewing my peers, I reaffirmed that 2 + 2 equals 4, noting that one draft correctly states this result, while another simply presents the answer without context. Moreover, an error noted in a third draft highlights the importance of ensuring accuracy in computations, which I addressed by upholding the validated answer.",
