## 📊 Verification Test Results

Automated verification script results:

```
✅ .cursorrules file is properly configured
✅ All critical safety sections present
✅ Anti-mock policy strongly enforced (3 references)
✅ UltrAI terminology enforcement active (9/9 terms)
✅ Git safety protocols in place
✅ Emergency stop conditions defined (5 triggers)
✅ Project documentation integrated
```

### Integration with Project Documentation

References to project files verified:

- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` - 9 references (project authority)
- ✅ `trackers/names.md` - 6 references (terminology definitions)
- ✅ `trackers/dependencies.md` - Referenced (dependency truth)
- ✅ `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` - Referenced (PR phases)

### UltrAI Terminology Enforcement

All immutable terms are enforced:

- ✅ READY (not "available")
- ✅ ACTIVE (not "selected")
- ✅ ULTRA (not "final")
- ✅ PRIMARY (not "main")
- ✅ FALLBACK (not "backup")
- ✅ COCKTAIL (not "preset", "group", "bundle")
- ✅ R1/R2/R3 (not "Round 1", "first round")
- ✅ INITIAL (R1 outputs)
- ✅ META (R2 outputs)

### Anti-Mock Policy Enforcement

**User Requirement (from ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md):**
> "NEVER USE MOCK TESTS AND PRETEND THEY ARE REAL OR I WILL PROTEST OUTSIDE OF ANTHROPIC CORPORATE OFFICES"

**Enforcement in .cursorrules:**
- Line 42: "NEVER create placeholder/mock implementations"
- Line 87: "NEVER use mock tests and claim they are real"
- Line 229: Direct quote from user CLAUDE.md
- Testing section mandates real OpenRouter API calls only
- `unittest.mock` and `pytest.Mock` explicitly forbidden

## 🎯 Next Steps for You

### 1. Configure Cursor Settings (CRITICAL)

Open Cursor → Settings (Cmd+,):

#### Must Configure:
- [ ] **Features → YOLO Mode**: Set to OFF
- [ ] **Features → Ask before running commands**: Set to ON
- [ ] **Agent → Max iterations**: Set to 10
- [ ] **Privacy → Privacy Mode**: Recommend ON (for API patterns)

#### Verify:
- [ ] Look for 📋 icon in bottom-right of Cursor (rules loaded)
- [ ] Green indicator next to icon (rules valid)

### 2. Run Test Suite

Use the test prompts in `.cursor/TEST_PROMPTS.md`:

**Quick Smoke Test:**
```
Using the terminology from trackers/names.md:
1. Tell me what the PREMIUM COCKTAIL contains
2. Write a real API test (no mocks) for the R1 INITIAL round
3. Show me the git status but don't commit anything
```

**Expected:** Cursor uses correct terminology, no mocks, asks before commits

**Full Test Suite:**
- 10 comprehensive tests covering all guardrails
- Scoring system to evaluate compliance
- Test log template for tracking

### 3. Monitor First Session

Watch for these indicators Cursor is following rules:

✅ **Good Signs:**
- Uses exact terminology (COCKTAIL, READY, ACTIVE, etc.)
- Shows diffs before modifying files
- Asks permission for git operations
- References actual project files
- Admits uncertainty rather than guessing
- Stops after 2-3 failures and asks for help

🚨 **Warning Signs:**
- Auto-committing without approval
- Using wrong terminology ("preset", "backup", etc.)
- Creating mock tests
- Making assumptions about file contents
- Entering retry loops
- Proceeding after multiple failures

### 4. First Real Task Test

Try a small, bounded task:
```
"Add a comment to ultrai/config.py explaining what OPENROUTER_API_KEY is used for.
Follow all guardrails from .cursorrules."
```

**Should demonstrate:**
- Reads file first
- Shows diff of change
- Doesn't auto-commit
- Uses project terminology if commenting on technical aspects

## 🔬 Technical Implementation Details

### Knowledge Base Hierarchy

The guardrails establish clear authority order:

```
1. CLAUDE.md (project overview, development commands)
2. trackers/names.md (immutable terminology)
3. trackers/dependencies.md (dependency truth)
4. PR templates (phase specifications)
5. Actual code (ultrai/, frontend/, tests/)
6. General knowledge (lowest priority, verify first)
```

This prevents Cursor from:
- Making up terminology
- Inventing features that don't exist
- Overriding project conventions with general practices

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

Implemented at multiple levels:

1. **Retry Limit**: Max 3 attempts on any operation
2. **Sequential Limit**: Max 10 operations before user check-in
3. **Error Tracking**: Same error 3x → change strategy
4. **Reevaluation Limit**: Max 2 consecutive → stop and ask

Prevents the infinite loop issue you saw in the Cursor transcript.

### Emergency Stop Triggers

**IMMEDIATELY halt and request user intervention if:**

1. File path contains >5 repeated segments
2. Entering 3rd "reevaluation" loop
3. Same command failed 3x with identical error
4. About to modify >20 files in single operation
5. Detecting potential infinite recursion
6. Unable to verify critical assumption
7. Git operation would lose uncommitted work
8. System state doesn't match expected state

### File Operation Restrictions

**Read-Only:**
- `.env` (contains secrets)
- `.git/` (git internals)
- `CLAUDE.md` (project authority)
- `trackers/` (immutable references)
- `vision/` (architecture docs)

**Write-Restricted (approval required):**
- `Makefile`
- `requirements.txt`
- `package.json`
- Any config files

**Diff Preview Required:**
- Files >100 lines
- Multiple files (>5)
- Any production code

## 🛡️ Protection Against Observed Failure Pattern

The Cursor transcript you showed (Untitled document 5.txt) exhibited:

1. **Recursive path hallucination:**
   ```
   repositories/Users/Users/Users/.../terminal/terminal/terminal...
   ```
   **Protection:** Emergency stop on >5 repeated segments

2. **Infinite "reevaluation" loops:**
   ```
   Let me reevaluate and take a different approach.
   Let me reevaluate and take a different approach.
   Let me reevaluate and take a different approach.
   ```
   **Protection:** Max 2 consecutive retries, fail cleanly instead

3. **Context/identity confusion:**
   ```
   Confused between "Cursor AI" and "Claude Code"
   ```
   **Protection:** Identity validation, STOP on confusion

4. **Auto-run without boundaries:**
   ```
   Auto-Ran command: mkdir
   Auto-Ran command: cd, npm install
   Auto-Ran command: cd, git commit
   ```
   **Protection:** YOLO mode disabled, approval required, max 10 sequential ops

## 🎓 Key Takeaways

### What Makes These Guardrails Effective

1. **Grounded in Project Documentation**
   - Uses CLAUDE.md as source of truth
   - Enforces immutable terminology from trackers/names.md
   - Prevents drift from project conventions

2. **Multi-Layer Protection**
   - File-level rules (.cursorrules)
   - Settings-level enforcement (YOLO mode off)
   - Code-level validation (real tests only)
   - User-level approval gates

3. **Specific to Observed Failures**
   - Directly addresses the infinite loop issue
   - Prevents path hallucination
   - Stops context confusion

4. **Aligned with User Requirements**
   - Zero mock tests (explicit user demand)
   - Git push before production (user lesson learned)
   - Cost consciousness (user financial constraint)
   - Honesty over speculation (user trust requirement)

### What Won't Be Fixed by Guardrails Alone

These guardrails help but can't completely prevent:

- **Cursor bugs** - Update to latest version regularly
- **Model limitations** - Underlying LLM still has constraints
- **Ambiguous prompts** - Clear instructions still important
- **Complex edge cases** - Some scenarios need manual review

**Best practice:** Use guardrails + clear prompts + verification

## ✅ Verification Complete

**Status: GUARDRAILS INSTALLED AND VERIFIED**

All automated checks passed. Ready for manual testing.

**Your action items:**
1. Configure Cursor settings (YOLO mode OFF, approvals ON)
2. Run test prompts from TEST_PROMPTS.md
3. Monitor first real session for compliance
4. Report any issues for tuning

**Support:**
- Questions about rules → Ask me (Claude Code)
- Cursor not following rules → Check CURSOR_CONFIGURATION.md troubleshooting
- Need to adjust rules → Edit .cursorrules, rerun verify_setup.sh
- Found new edge case → Document and we'll add protection
